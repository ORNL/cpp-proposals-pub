# Revision history

  * Revision 0 (pre-Cologne) submitted 2019-06-17

    * Received feedback in Cologne from SG6, LEWGI, and (???).

  * Revision 1 (pre-Belfast) to be submitted 2019-10-07

    * Account for Cologne 2019 feedback

      * Make interface more consistent with existing Standard algorithms

      * Change `dot`, `dotc`, `vector_norm2`, and `vector_abs_sum` to
          imitate `reduce`, so that they return their result, instead of
          taking an output parameter.  Users may set the result type via
          optional `init` parameter.

    * Minor changes to "expression template" classes, based on
        implementation experience

    * Briefly address LEWGI request of exploring concepts for input arguments.

    * Lazy ranges style API was NOT explored.

  * Revision 2 (pre-Cologne) to be submitted 2020-01-13

    * Add "Future work" section.

    * Remove "Options and votes" section (which were addressed in SG6,
        SG14, and LEWGI).

    * Remove `basic_mdarray` overloads.

    * Remove batched linear algebra operations.

    * Remove over- and underflow requirement for `vector_norm2`.

    * *Mandate* any extent compatibility checks that can be done at
        compile time.

    * Add missing functions `{symmetric,hermitian}_matrix_rank_k_update`
        and `triangular_matrix_{left,right}_product`.

    * Remove `packed_view` function.

    * Fix wording for `{conjugate,transpose,conjugate_transpose}_view`,
        so that implementations may optimize the return type.  Make sure
        that `transpose_view` of a `layout_blas_packed` matrix returns a
        `layout_blas_packed` matrix with opposite `Triangle` and
        `StorageOrder`.

    * Remove second template parameter `T` from `accessor_conjugate`.

    * Make `scaled_scalar` and `conjugated_scalar` exposition only.

    * Add in-place overloads of
        `triangular_matrix_matrix_{left,right}_solve`,
        `triangular_matrix_{left,right}_product`, and
        `triangular_matrix_vector_solve`.

    * Add `alpha` overloads to
        `{symmetric,hermitian}_matrix_rank_{1,k}_update`.

    * Add Cholesky factorization and solve examples.

  * Revision 3 (electronic) to be submitted 2021-04-15

    * Per LEWG request, add a section on our investigation
        of constraining template parameters with concepts,
        in the manner of P1813R0 with the numeric algorithms.
        We concluded that we disagree with the approach of P1813R0,
        and that the Standard's current *GENERALIZED_SUM* approach
        better expresses numeric algorithms' behavior.

    * Update references to the current revision of P0009 (`mdspan`).

    * Per LEWG request, introduce `std::linalg` namespace and put everything in there.

    * Per LEWG request, replace the `linalg_` prefix with the aforementioned namespace.
        We renamed `linalg_add` to `add`,
        `linalg_copy` to `copy`, and
        `linalg_swap` to `swap_elements`.

    * Per LEWG request, do not use `_view` as a suffix,
        to avoid confusion with "views" in the sense of Ranges.
        We renamed `conjugate_view` to `conjugated`,
        `conjugate_transpose_view` to `conjugate_transposed`,
        `scaled_view` to `scaled`, and
        `transpose_view` to `transposed`.

    * Change wording from "then implementations will use `T`'s precision or greater
        for intermediate terms in the sum,"
        to "then intermediate terms in the sum use `T`'s precision or greater."
        Thanks to Jens Maurer for this suggestion (and many others!).

    * Before, a Note on `vector_norm2` said,
        "We recommend that implementers document their guarantees regarding overflow and underflow
        of `vector_norm2` for floating-point return types."
        Implementations always document "implementation-defined behavior" per **[defs.impl.defined]**.
        (Thanks to Jens Maurer for pointing out that "We recommend..." does not belong in the Standard.)
        Thus, we changed this from a Note to normative wording in Remarks:
        "If either `in_vector_t::element_type` or `T` are
        floating-point types or complex versions thereof,
        then any guarantees regarding overflow and underflow of `vector_norm2`
        are implementation-defined."

    * Define return types of the
        `dot`, `dotc`, `vector_norm2`, and `vector_abs_sum` overloads
        with `auto` return type.

    * Remove the explicitly stated constraint on `add` and `copy`
        that the rank of the array arguments be no more than 2.
        This is redundant, because we already impose this
        via the existing constraints on template parameters named
        `in_object*_t`, `inout_object*_t`, or `out_object*_t`.
        If we later wish to relax this restriction,
        then we only have to do so in one place.

    * Add `vector_sum_of_squares`.
        First, this gives implementers a path to implementing `vector_norm2`
        in a way that achieves the over/underflow guarantees
        intended by the BLAS Standard.
        Second, this is a useful algorithm in itself
        for parallelizing vector 2-norm computation.

    * Add `matrix_frob_norm`, `matrix_one_norm`, and `matrix_inf_norm`
        (thanks to coauthor Piotr Luszczek).

    * Address LEWG request for us to investigate support for GPU memory.
        See section "Explicit support for asynchronous return of scalar values."

    * Add `ExecutionPolicy` overloads of the in-place versions of
        `triangular_matrix_vector_solve`,
        `triangular_matrix_left_product`,
        `triangular_matrix_right_product`,
        `triangular_matrix_matrix_left_solve`, and
        `triangular_matrix_matrix_right_solve`.

  * Revision 4 (electronic), to be submitted 2021-08-15

    * Update authors' contact info.

    * Rebase atop P2299R3, which in turn sits atop P0009R12.
        Make any needed fixes due to these changes.
        (P1673R3 was based on P0009R10, without P2299.)
        Update P0009 references to point to the latest version (R12).

    * Fix requirements for `{symmetric,hermitian}_matrix_{left,right}_product`.

    * Change `SemiRegular<Scalar>` to `semiregular<Scalar>`.

    * Make `Real` requirements refer to **[complex.numbers.general]**,
        rather than explicitly listing allowed types.
        Remove redundant constraints on `Real`.

    * In **[linalg.algs.reqs]**, clarify that "unique layout"
        for output matrix, vector, or object types
        means `is_always_unique()` equals `true`.

    * Change file format from Markdown to Bikeshed.

    * Impose requirements on the types on which algorithms compute,
        and on the algorithms themselves (e.g., what rearrangements are permitted).
        Add a section explaining how we came up with the requirements.
        Lift the requirements into a new higher-level section
        that applies to the entire contents of **[linalg]**,
        not just to **[linalg.algs]**.

    * Add "Overview of contents" section.

    * In the last review, LEWG had asked us to consider using exposition-only concepts
        and `requires` clauses to express requirements more clearly.
        We decided not to do so, because we did not think it would add clarity.

    * Add more examples.

  * Revision 5 (electronic), to be submitted 2021-10-15

    * P0009R13 (to be submitted 2021-10-15) changes `mdspan` to use `operator[]`
        instead of `operator()` as the array access operator.
        Revision 5 of P1673 adopts this change, and is "rebased" atop P1673R5.

  * Revision 6 (electronic), to be submitted 2021-12-15

    * Update references to P0009 (P0009R14) and P2128 (P2128R6).

    * Fix typos in `*rank_2k` descriptions.

    * Remove references to any `mdspan` rank greater than 2.
        (These were left over from earlier versions of the proposal
        that included "batched" operations.)
    
    * Fix `vector_sum_of_squares` name in BLAS comparison table.

    * Replace "Requires" with "Preconditions," per new wording guidelines.

    * Remove all overloads of `symmetric_matrix_rank_k_update` and
        `hermitian_matrix_rank_k_update` that do not take an `alpha` parameter.
        This prevents ambiguity between overloads
        that take `ExecutionPolicy&&` but not `alpha`,
        and overloads that take `alpha` but not `ExecutionPolicy&&`.
    
    * Harmonize with the implementation, by adding `operator+`, `operator*`,
        and comparison operators to `conjugated_scalar`.

  * Revision 7 (electronic), to be submitted 2022-04-15

    * Update author affiliations and e-mail addresses

    * Update proposal references

    * Fix typo observed <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/stdBLAS/issues/158">here</a>

    * Add missing `ExecutionPolicy` overload of in-place
        `triangular_matrix_vector_product`; issue was observed
        <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/stdBLAS/issues/150">here</a>

    * Fix mixed-up order of `sum_of_squares_result` aggregate initialization arguments
        in `vector_norm2` note

    * Fill in missing parts of `matrix_frob_norm` and `vector_norm2` specification, addressing <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/stdBLAS/issues/143">this issue</a>

  * Revision 8 (electronic), to be submitted 2022-05-15

    * Fix `Triangle` and `R[0,0]` in Cholesky TSQR example

    * Explain why we apply `Triangle` to the possibly transformed input matrix,
        while the BLAS applies `UPLO` to the original input matrix

    * Optimize `transposed` for all known layouts,
        so as to avoid use of `layout_transpose` when not needed;
        fix computation of strides for transposed layouts

    * Fix matrix extents in constraints and mandates
        for `symmetric_matrix_rank_k_update` and `hermitian_matrix_rank_k_update`
        (thanks to Mikołaj Zuzek (NexGen Analytics, `mikolaj.zuzek@ng-analytics.com`) 
        for reporting the issue)

    * Resolve vagueness in `const`ness of return type of `transposed`

    * Resolve vagueness in `const`ness of return type of `scaled`,
        and make its element type the type of the product,
        rather than forcing it back to the input `mdspan`'s element type

    * Remove `decay` member function from `accessor_conjugate` and `accessor_scaled`,
        as it is no longer part of `mdspan`'s accessor policy requirements

    * Make sure `accessor_conjugate` and `conjugated` work correctly
        for user-defined complex types,
        introduce _`conj-if-needed`_ to simplify wording,
        and resolve vagueness in `const`ness of return type of `conjugated`.
        Make sure that _`conj-if-needed`_ works for custom types
        where `conj` is not type-preserving.
        (Thanks to Yu You (NVIDIA, yuyou@nvidia.com) and
        Phil Miller (Intense Computing, `phil.miller@intensecomputing.com`)
        for helpful discussions.)

    * Fix typo in `givens_rotation_setup` for complex numbers, and other typos
        (thanks to Phil Miller for reporting the issue)

  * Revision 9 (electronic), to be submitted 2022-06-15

    * Apply to-be-submitted P0009R17 changes (see P2553 in particular)
        to all layouts, accessors, and examples in this proposal.

    * Improve `triangular_matrix_matrix_{left,right}_solve()`
        "mathematical expression of the algorithm" wording.

    * `layout_blas_packed`: Fix `required_span_size()` and `operator()` wording

    * Make sure all definitions of lower and upper triangle are consistent.

    * Changes to `layout_transpose`:

        * Make `layout_transpose::mapping(const nested_mapping_type&)` constructor
            `explicit`, to avoid inadvertent transposition.

        * Remove the following Constraint on `layout_transpose::mapping`: 
            "for all specializations `E` of `extents` with `E::rank()` equal to 2,
            `typename Layout::template mapping<E>::is_always_unique()` is `true`."
	    (This Constraint was not correct, because the underlying mapping
	    is allowed to be nonunique.)

        * Make `layout_transpose::mapping::stride` wording
	    independent of `rank()` equals 2 constraint,
	    to improve consistency with rest of `layout_transpose` wording.

    * Changes to `scaled` and `conjugated`:

        * Include and specify all the needed overloaded arithmetic operators
	    for `scaled_scalar` and `conjugated_scalar`, and
	    fix `accessor_scaled` and `accessor_conjugate` accordingly.

        * Simplify `scaled` to ensure preservation of order of operations.

        * Add missing `nested_accessor()` to `accessor_scaled`.

        * Add hidden friends `abs`, `real`, `imag`, and `conj`
	    to common subclass of `scaled_scalar` and `conjugated_scalar`.
            Add wording to algorithms that use `abs`, `real`, and/or `imag`,
	    to indicate that these functions are to be found
	    by unqualified lookup.
	    (Algorithms that use conjugation already use _`conj-if-needed`_
	    in their wording.)

    * Changes suggested by SG6 small group review on 2022/06/09

        * Make existing exposition-only function _`conj-if-needed`_
	          use `conj` if it can find it via unqualified (ADL-only) lookup,
	          otherwise be the identity.
	          Make it a function object instead of a function,
	          to prevent ADL issues.

        * Algorithms that mathematically need to do division
	    can now distinguish left division and right division
	    (for the case of noncommutative multiplication),
	    by taking an optional `BinaryDivideOp`
	    binary function object parameter.
	    If none is given, binary `operator/` is used.

    * Changes suggested by LEWG review of P1673R8 on 2022/05/24

        * LEWG asked us to add a section to the paper
            explaining why we don't define an interface
            for customization of the "back-end" optimized BLAS operations.
            This section already existed, but we rewrote it
	          to improve clarity.  Please see the section titled
            "We do not require using the BLAS library
            or any particular 'back-end'."

        * LEWG asked us to add a section to the paper
            showing how BLAS 1 and ranges algorithms would coexist.
            We added this section, titled
            "Criteria for including BLAS 1 algorithms;
            coexistence with ranges."

        * Address LEWG feedback to defer support
	          for custom complex number types
	          (but see above SG6 small group response).

    * Fix P1674 links to point to R2.

  * Revision 10 (electronic), submitted 2022-10-15

    * Revise `scaled` and `conjugated` wording.

    * Make all matrix view functions `constexpr`.

    * Rebase atop P2642R1.
        Remove wording saying that we rebase atop P0009R17.
        (We don't need that any more, because P0009
        was merged into the current C++ draft.)

    * Remove `layout_blas_general`, as it has been replaced
        with the layouts proposed by P2642
        (`layout_left_padded` and `layout_right_padded`).

    * Update `layout_blas_packed` to match mdspan's other layout mappings
        in the current C++ Standard draft.

    * Update accessors to match mdspan's other accessors
        in the current C++ Standard draft.

    * Update non-wording to reflect current status of `mdspan`
        (voted into C++ Standard draft) and `submdspan` (P2630).

  * Revision 11, to be submitted 2023-01-15

    * Remove requirement that `in_{vector,matrix,object}*_t`
        have unique layout.

    * Change from name-based requirements (`in_{vector,matrix,object}*_t`)
        to exposition-only concepts.
        (This is our interpretation of LEWG's Kona 2022/11/10 request
        to "explore expressing constraints with concepts
        instead of named type requirements"
        (see https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/557#issuecomment-1311054803).)
        Add new section for exposition-only concepts and traits.

    * Add new exposition-only concept
        _`possibly-packed-inout-matrix`_
        to constrain symmetric and Hermitian update algorithms.
        These may write either to a unique-layout mdspan
        or to a `layout_blas_packed` mdspan
        (whose layout is nonunique).

    * Remove Constraints made redundant
        by the new exposition-only concepts.

    * Remove unnecessary constraint on all algorithms
      that input `mdspan` parameter(s) have unique layout.

    * Remove the requirement that
        vector / matrix / object template parameters
        may deduce a `const` lvalue reference
        or a (non-`const`) rvalue reference to an `mdspan`.
        The new exposition-only concepts make this unnecessary.

    * Fix `dot` Remarks to include both vector types.

    * Fix wording of several functions and examples
      to use `mdspan`'s `value_type` alias
      instead of its (potentially cv-qualified) `element_type` alias.
      This includes `dot`, `vector_sum_of_squares`, `vector_norm2`,
      `vector_abs_sum`, `matrix_frob_norm`, `matrix_one_norm`,
      `matrix_inf_norm`, and the QR factorization example.

    * Make `matrix_vector_product` template parameter order
        consistent with parameter order.

    * Follow LEWG guidance to simplify Effects and Constraints
      (e.g., removing wording referring to the
      "the mathematical expression for the algorithm")
      by describing them mathematically (in math font).
      ("Mathematical expression for the algorithm"
      remains in a few places that call for more careful analysis.)
      This is our interpretation of the "hand wavy do math" poll option
      that received a majority of votes at Kona on 2022/11/10
      (see https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/557#issuecomment-1311054803).

    * Change `matrix_one_norm` Precondition
        (that the result of `abs` of a matrix element
        is convertible to `T`) to a Constraint.

    * Change `vector_abs_sum` Precondition
        (that the result of `init + abs(v[i])`
        is convertible to `T`) to a Constraint.

    * Reformat entire document to use Pandoc instead of Bikeshed.
      This made it possible to add paragraph numbers
      and fix exposition-only italics.

    * In _`conjugated-scalar`_, make
        _`conjugatable`_`<ReferenceValue>`
        a Constraint instead of a Mandate.

    * Delete "If an algorithm in *[linalg.algs]* accesses the elements
        of an _`out-vector`_, _`out-matrix`_, or _`out-object`_,
        it will do so in write-only fashion."
        This would prevent implementations from, e.g.,
        zero-initializing the elements and then updating them with `+=`.

    * Rebase atop P2642R2 (updating from R1).

    * Add `explicit` defaulted default constructors
        to all the tag types, in imitation of `in_place_t`.

# Purpose of this paper

This paper proposes a C++ Standard Library dense linear algebra
interface based on the dense Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS).
This corresponds to a subset of the
[BLAS Standard](http://www.netlib.org/blas/blast-forum/blas-report.pdf).
Our proposal implements the following classes of algorithms on arrays that represent
matrices and vectors:

* elementwise vector sums;
* multiplying all elements of a vector or matrix by a scalar;
* 2-norms and 1-norms of vectors;
* vector-vector, matrix-vector, and matrix-matrix products (contractions);
* low-rank updates of a matrix;
* triangular solves with one or more "right-hand side" vectors; and
* generating and applying plane (Givens) rotations.

Our algorithms work with most of the matrix storage formats that the BLAS
Standard supports:

* "general" dense matrices, in column-major or row-major format;
* symmetric or Hermitian (for complex numbers only) dense matrices,
    stored either as general dense matrices, or in a packed format; and
* dense triangular matrices, stored either as general dense matrices
    or in a packed format.

Our proposal also has the following distinctive characteristics.

* It uses free functions, not arithmetic operator overloading.

* The interface is designed in the spirit of the C++ Standard Library's
    algorithms.

* It uses `mdspan` (P0009 and follow-on papers,
    which have been adopted into the C++23 draft),
    a multidimensional array view, to represent matrices and vectors.

* The interface permits optimizations for matrices and vectors with
    small compile-time dimensions; the standard BLAS interface does not.

* Each of our proposed operations supports all element types for which
    that operation makes sense, unlike the BLAS, which only supports
    four element types.

* Our operations permit "mixed-precision" computation with matrices
    and vectors that have different element types.  This subsumes most
    functionality of the Mixed-Precision BLAS specification,
    comprising Chapter 4 of the
    <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/blast-forum/blas-report.pdf">BLAS Standard</a>.

* Like the C++ Standard Library's algorithms, our operations take an
    optional execution policy argument.  This is a hook to support
    parallel execution and hierarchical parallelism (through the
    proposed executor extensions to execution policies; see
    P1019R2).

* Unlike the BLAS, our proposal can be expanded to support "batched"
    operations (see P1417R0) with almost no
    interface differences.  This will support machine learning and other
    applications that need to do many small matrix or vector operations
    at once.

Here are some examples of what this proposal offers.
In these examples, we ignore `std::` namespace qualification
for anything in our proposal or for `mdspan`.
We start with a "hello world" that scales the elements of a 1-D `mdspan`
by a constant factor, first sequentially, then in parallel.

```c++
  constexpr size_t N = 40;
  std::vector<double> x_vec(N);

  mdspan x(x_vec.data(), N);
  for(size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    x[i] = double(i);
  }

  linalg::scale(2.0, x); // x = 2.0 * x
  linalg::scale(std::execution::par_unseq, 3.0, x);
  for(size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    assert(x[i] == 6.0 * double(i));
  }
```

Here is a matrix-vector product example.
It illustrates the `scaled` function that makes our interface more concise,
while still permitting the BLAS' performance optimization
of fusing computations with multiplications by a scalar.
It also shows the ability to exploit dimensions known at compile time,
and to mix compile-time and run-time dimensions arbitrarily.

```c++
constexpr size_t N = 40;
constexpr size_t M = 20;

std::vector<double> A_vec(N*M);
std::vector<double> x_vec(M);
std::array<double, N> y_vec(N);

mdspan A(A_vec.data(), N, M);
mdspan x(x_vec.data(), M);
mdspan y(y_vec.data(), N);

for(int i = 0; i < A.extent(0); ++i) {
  for(int j = 0; j < A.extent(1); ++j) {
    A[i,j] = 100.0 * i + j;
  }
}
for(int j = 0; j < x.extent(0); ++j) {
  x[i] = 1.0 * j;
}
for(int i = 0; i < y.extent(0); ++i) {
  y[i] = -1.0 * i;
}

linalg::matrix_vector_product(A, x, y); // y = A * x

// y = 0.5 * y + 2 * A * x
linalg::matrix_vector_product(std::execution::par,
  linalg::scaled(2.0, A), x,
  linalg::scaled(0.5, y), y);
```

This example illustrates the ability to perform mixed-precision computations,
and the ability to compute on subviews of a matrix or vector
by using `submdspan` (P2630).  (`submdspan` was separated from the rest of P0009
as a way to avoid delaying the hopeful adoption of P0009 for C++23.
The reference implementation of `mdspan` includes `submdspan`.)

```c++
constexpr size_t M = 40;

std::vector<float> A_vec(M*8*4);
std::vector<double> x_vec(M*4);
std::vector<double> y_vec(M*8);

mdspan<float, extents<size_t, dynamic_extent, 8, 4>> A(A_vec.data(), M);
mdspan<double, extents<size_t, 4, dynamic_extent>> x(x_vec.data(), M);
mdspan<double, extents<size_t, dynamic_extent, 8>> y(y_vec.data(), M);

for(size_t m = 0; m < A.extent(0); ++m) {
  for(size_t i = 0; i < A.extent(1); ++i) {
    for(size_t j = 0; j < A.extent(2); ++j) {
      A[m,i,j] = 1000.0 * m + 100.0 * i + j;
    }
  }
}
for(size_t i = 0; i < x.extent(0); ++i) {
  for(size_t m = 0; m < x.extent(1); ++m) {
    x[i,m] = 33. * i + 0.33 * m;
  }
}
for(size_t m = 0; m < y.extent(0); ++m) {
  for(size_t i = 0; i < y.extent(1); ++i) {
    y[m,i] = 33. * m + 0.33 * i;
  }
}

for(size_t m = 0; m < M; ++m) {
  auto A_m = submdspan(A, m, full_extent, full_extent);
  auto x_m = submdspan(x, full_extent, m);
  auto y_m = submdspan(y, m, full_extent);
  // y_m = A * x_m
  linalg::matrix_vector_product(A_m, x_m, y_m);
}
```

# Overview of contents

Section <a href="#interoperable-with-other-linear-algebra-proposals"><span class="secno">5</span></a>
explains how this proposal is interoperable with other linear algebra proposals currently under WG21 review.
In particular, we believe this proposal is complementary to P1385R6,
and the authors of P1385R6 have expressed the same view.

Section <a href="#why-include-dense-linear-algebra-in-the-c-standard-library"><span class="secno">6</span></a>
motivates considering *any* dense linear algebra proposal for the C++ Standard Library.

Section <a href="#why-base-a-c-linear-algebra-library-on-the-blas"><span class="secno">7</span></a>
shows why we chose the BLAS as a starting point for our proposed library.
The BLAS is an existing standard with decades of use,
a rich set of functions,
and many optimized implementations.

Section <a href="#criteria-for-including-algorithms"><span class="secno">8</span></a>
lists what we consider general criteria for including algorithms in the C++ Standard Library.
We rely on these criteria to justify the algorithms in this proposal.

Section <a href="#notation-and-conventions"><span class="secno">9</span></a>
describes BLAS notation and conventions in C++ terms.
Understanding this will give readers context for algorithms,
and show how our proposed algorithms expand on BLAS functionality.

Section <a href="#what-we-exclude-from-the-design"><span class="secno">10</span></a>
lists functionality that we intentionally exclude from our proposal.
We imitate the BLAS in aiming to be a set of "performance primitives"
on which external libraries or applications
may build a more complete linear algebra solution.

Section <a href="#design-justification"><span class="secno">11</span></a>
elaborates on our design justification.
This section explains

* why we use `mdspan` to represent matrix and vector parameters;

* how we translate the BLAS' Fortran-centric idioms into C++;

* how the BLAS' different "matrix types" map to different algorithms,
    rather than different `mdspan` layouts;

* how we express quality-of-implementation recommendations
    about avoiding undue overflow and underflow; and

* how we impose requirements on algorithms' behavior
    and on the various value types that algorithms encounter.

Section <a href="#future-work"><span class="secno">12</span></a>
lists future work, that is, ways future proposals could build on this one.

Section <a href="#data-structures-and-utilities-borrowed-from-other-proposals"><span class="secno">13</span></a>
gives the data structures and utilities from other proposals on which we depend.
In particular, we rely heavily on `mdspan` (P0009),
and add custom layouts and accessors.

Section <a href="#acknowledgments"><span class="secno">14</span></a> credits funding agencies and contributors.

Section <a href="#references"><span class="secno">15</span></a> is our bibliography.

Section <a href="#wording"><span class="secno">16</span></a>
is where readers will find the normative wording we propose.

Finally, Section <a href="#examples"><span class="secno">17</span></a>
gives some more elaborate examples of linear algebra algorithms that use our proposal.
The examples show how `mdspan`'s features let users easily describe "submatrices" with `submdspan`,
proposed in P2630 as a follow-on to mdspan.
(The reference implementation of `mdspan` includes `submdspan`.)
This integrates naturally with "block" factorizations of matrices.
The resulting notation is concise, yet still computes in place,
without unnecessary copies of any part of the matrix.

Here is a table that maps between Reference BLAS function name,
and algorithm or function name in our proposal.
The mapping is not always one to one.
"N/A" in the "BLAS name(s)" field means that the function is not in the BLAS.

# Interoperable with other linear algebra proposals

We believe this proposal is complementary to P1385R6,
a proposal for a C++ Standard linear algebra library
that introduces matrix and vector classes with overloaded arithmetic operators.
The P1385 authors and we have expressed together in a joint paper,
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1891r0.pdf">P1891</a>,
that P1673 and P1385 "are orthogonal.
They are not competing papers; ...
there is no overlap of functionality."

Many of us have had experience using and implementing
matrix and vector operator arithmetic libraries like what P1385 proposes.
We designed P1673 in part as a natural foundation or implementation layer for such libraries.
Our view is that a free function interface like P1673's
clearly separates algorithms from data structures,
and more naturally allows for a richer set of operations such as what the BLAS provides.
Our paper <a href="https://wg21.link/p1674">P1674</a>
explains why we think our proposal is a minimal C++ "respelling" of the BLAS.

A natural extension of the present proposal would include
accepting P1385's matrix and vector objects as input
for the algorithms proposed here.
A straightforward way to do that would be for P1385's matrix and vector objects
to make views of their data available as `mdspan`.

# Why include dense linear algebra in the C++ Standard Library?

1. "Direction for ISO C++" (P0939R4)
    explicitly calls out "Linear Algebra" as a potential priority for C++23.

2. C++ applications in "important application areas" (see P0939R4)
    have depended on linear algebra for a long time.

3. Linear algebra is like `sort`: obvious algorithms are slow, and the
    fastest implementations call for hardware-specific tuning.

4. Dense linear algebra is core functionality for most of linear
    algebra, and can also serve as a building block for tensor
    operations.

5. The C++ Standard Library includes plenty of "mathematical
    functions."  Linear algebra operations like matrix-matrix multiply
    are at least as broadly useful.

6. The set of linear algebra operations in this proposal are derived
    from a well-established, standard set of algorithms that has
    changed very little in decades.  It is one of the strongest
    possible examples of standardizing existing practice that anyone
    could bring to C++.

7. This proposal follows in the footsteps of many recent successful
    incorporations of existing standards into C++, including the UTC
    and TAI standard definitions from the International
    Telecommunications Union, the time zone database standard from the
    International Assigned Numbers Authority, and the ongoing effort to
    integrate the ISO unicode standard.

Linear algebra has had wide use in C++ applications for nearly three
decades (see P1417R0 for a historical survey).
For much of that time, many third-party C++ libraries for linear
algebra have been available.  Many different subject areas depend on
linear algebra, including machine learning, data mining, web search,
statistics, computer graphics, medical imaging, geolocation and
mapping, engineering, and physics-based simulations.

"Directions for ISO C++" (P0939R4)
not only lists "Linear Algebra" explicitly as a potential C++23 priority,
it also offers the following
in support of adding linear algebra to the C++ Standard Library.

* P0939R4 calls out "Support for demanding applications"
    in "important application areas,
    such as medical, finance, automotive, and games
    (e.g., key libraries...)" as an "area of general concern" that "we
    should not ignore."  All of these areas depend on linear algebra.

* "Is my proposal essential for some important application domain?"
    Many large and small private companies, science and engineering
    laboratories, and academics in many different fields all depend on
    linear algebra.

* "We need better support for modern hardware": Modern hardware spends
    many of its cycles in linear algebra.  For decades, hardware
    vendors, some represented at WG21 meetings, have provided and
    continue to provide features specifically to accelerate linear
    algebra operations.  Some of them even implement specific linear
    algebra operations directly in hardware.  Examples include NVIDIA's
    <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensorcore/">Tensor Cores</a>
    and Cerebras'
    <a href="https://www.cerebras.net/product/#chip">Wafer Scale Engine</a>.
    Several large computer system vendors offer optimized linear algebra libraries
    based on or closely resembling the BLAS.  These include AMD's BLIS,
    ARM's Performance Libraries, Cray's LibSci, Intel's Math Kernel
    Library (MKL), IBM's Engineering and Scientific Subroutine Library
    (ESSL), and NVIDIA's cuBLAS.

Obvious algorithms for some linear algebra operations like dense
matrix-matrix multiply are asymptotically slower than less-obvious
algorithms.  (Please refer to a survey one of us coauthored,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0962492914000038">
"Communication lower bounds and optimal algorithms
for numerical linear algebra."</a>
Furthermore, writing the fastest dense matrix-matrix multiply depends
on details of a specific computer architecture.  This makes such
operations comparable to `sort` in the C++ Standard Library: worth
standardizing, so that Standard Library implementers can get them
right and hardware vendors can optimize them.  In fact, almost all C++
linear algebra libraries end up calling non-C++ implementations of
these algorithms, especially the implementations in optimized BLAS
libraries (see below).  In this respect, linear algebra is also
analogous to standard library features like `random_device`: often
implemented directly in assembly or even with special hardware, and
thus an essential component of allowing no room for another language
"below" C++ (see P0939R4)
and Stroustrup's "The Design and Evolution of C++").

Dense linear algebra is the core component of most algorithms and
applications that use linear algebra, and the component that is most
widely shared over different application areas.  For example, tensor
computations end up spending most of their time in optimized dense
linear algebra functions.  Sparse matrix computations get best
performance when they spend as much time as possible in dense linear
algebra.

The C++ Standard Library includes many
<a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/sf.cmath">"mathematical special functions"</a>
(**[sf.cmath]**), like incomplete elliptic integrals,
Bessel functions, and other polynomials and functions named after
various mathematicians.  Any of them comes with its own theory and set
of applications for which robust and accurate implementations are
indispensible.  We think that linear algebra operations are at least
as broadly useful, and in many cases significantly more so.

# Why base a C++ linear algebra library on the BLAS?

1. The BLAS is a standard that codifies decades of existing practice.

2. The BLAS separates "performance primitives" for hardware
    experts to tune, from mathematical operations that rely on those
    primitives for good performance.

3. Benchmarks reward hardware and system vendors for providing
    optimized BLAS implementations.

4. Writing a fast BLAS implementation for common element types is
    nontrivial, but well understood.

5. Optimized third-party BLAS implementations with liberal software
    licenses exist.

6. Building a C++ interface on top of the BLAS is a straightforward
    exercise, but has pitfalls for unaware developers.

Linear algebra has had a cross-language standard, the Basic Linear
Algebra Subroutines (BLAS), since 2002.  The Standard came out of a
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/blast-forum/">standardization process</a>
that started in 1995 and held meetings three times a year until 1999.
Participants in the process came from industry, academia, and
government research laboratories.  The dense linear algebra subset of
the BLAS codifies forty years of evolving practice, and has existed in
recognizable form since 1990 (see P1417R0).

The BLAS interface was specifically designed as the distillation of
the "computer science" or performance-oriented parts of linear algebra
algorithms.  It cleanly separates operations most critical for
performance, from operations whose implementation takes expertise in
mathematics and rounding-error analysis.  This gives vendors
opportunities to add value, without asking for expertise outside the
typical required skill set of a Standard Library implementer.

Well-established benchmarks such as the
<a href="https://www.top500.org/project/linpack/">LINPACK benchmark</a>,
reward computer hardware vendors for optimizing their BLAS implementations.
Thus, many vendors provide an optimized BLAS library for their computer
architectures.  Writing fast BLAS-like operations is not trivial, and
depends on computer architecture.  However, it is a well-understood
problem whose solutions could be parameterized for a variety of
computer architectures.  See, for example,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1356052.1356053">Goto and van de Geijn 2008</a>.
There are optimized
third-party BLAS implementations for common architectures, like
<a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> and
<a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-software/gotoblas2">GotoBLAS</a>.
A (slow but correct)
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/#_reference_blas_version_3_8_0">reference implementation of the BLAS</a>
exists and it has a liberal software license for easy reuse.

We have experience in the exercise of wrapping a C or Fortran BLAS
implementation for use in portable C++ libraries.  We describe this
exercise in detail in our paper
"Evolving a Standard C++ Linear Algebra Library from the BLAS"
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1674">(P1674)</a>.
It is straightforward for vendors, but has pitfalls for developers.  For
example, Fortran's application binary interface (ABI) differs across
platforms in ways that can cause run-time errors (even incorrect
results, not just crashing).  Historical examples of vendors' C BLAS
implementations have also had ABI issues that required work-arounds.
This dependence on ABI details makes availability in a standard C++
library valuable.

# Criteria for including algorithms

## Criteria for all the algorithms

We include algorithms in our proposal based on the following criteria,
ordered by decreasing importance.
Many of our algorithms satisfy multiple criteria.

1. Getting the desired asymptotic run time is nontrivial

2. Opportunity for vendors to provide hardware-specific optimizations

3. Opportunity for vendors to provide quality-of-implementation improvements,
    especially relating to accuracy or reproducibility
    with respect to floating-point rounding error

4. User convenience (familiar name, or tedious to implement)

Regarding (1), "nontrivial" means "at least for novices to the field."
Dense matrix-matrix multiply is a good example.
Getting close to the asymptotic lower bound on the number of memory reads and writes
matters a lot for performance, and calls for a nonintuitive loop reordering.
An analogy to the current C++ Standard Library is `sort`,
where intuitive algorithms that many humans use are not asymptotically optimal.

Regarding (2), a good example is copying multidimensional arrays.
The <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos">Kokkos library</a>
spends about 2500 lines of code on multidimensional array copy,
yet still relies on system libraries for low-level optimizations.
An analogy to the current C++ Standard Library is `copy` or even `memcpy`.

Regarding (3), accurate floating-point summation is nontrivial.
Well-meaning compiler optimizations might defeat even simple technqiues,
like compensated summation.
The most obvious way to compute a vector's Euclidean norm
(square root of sum of squares) can cause overflow or underflow,
even when the exact answer is much smaller than the overflow threshold,
or larger than the underflow threshold.
Some users care deeply about sums, even parallel sums,
that always get the same answer, despite rounding error.
This can help debugging, for example.
It is possible to make floating-point sums completely independent
of parallel evaluation order.
See e.g., the
<a href="https://bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/reproblas/">ReproBLAS</a>
effort.
Naming these algorithms and providing `ExecutionPolicy` customization hooks
gives vendors a chance to provide these improvements.
An analogy to the current C++ Standard Library is `hypot`,
whose language in the C++ Standard alludes to the tighter POSIX requirements.

Regarding (4), the C++ Standard Library is not entirely minimalist.
One example is `std::string::contains`.
Existing Standard Library algorithms already offered this functionality,
but a member `contains` function is easy for novices to find and use,
and avoids the tedium of comparing the result of `find` to `npos`.

The BLAS exists mainly for the first two reasons.
It includes functions that were nontrivial for compilers to optimize in its time,
like scaled elementwise vector sums,
as well as functions that generally require human effort to optimize,
like matrix-matrix multiply.

## Criteria for including BLAS 1 algorithms; coexistence with ranges

The BLAS developed in three "levels": 1, 2, and 3.
BLAS 1 includes "vector-vector" operations like dot products, norms, and vector addition.
BLAS 2 includes "matrix-vector" operations like matrix-vector products and outer products.
BLAS 3 includes "matrix-matrix" operations like matrix-matrix products
and triangular solve with multiple "right-hand side" vectors.
The BLAS level coincides with the number of nested loops
in a naïve sequential implementation of the operation.
Increasing level also comes with increasing potential for data reuse.
For history of the BLAS "levels" and a bibliography,
see <a href="https://wg21.link/p1417">P1417</a>.

We mention this here because some reviewers have asked
how the algorithms in our proposal would coexist
with the existing ranges algorithms in the C++ Standard Library.
This question actually encloses two questions.

1. Will our proposed algorithms syntactically collide
    with existing ranges algorithms?

2. How much overlap do our proposed algorithms
    have with the existing ranges algorithms?
    (That is, do we really need these new algorithms?)

### Low risk of synactic collision with ranges

We think there is low risk of our proposal
colliding syntactically with existing ranges algorithms,
for the following reasons.

* We propose our algorithms in a new namespace `std::linalg`.

* None of the algorithms we propose share names with any existing ranges algorithms.

* We take care not to use `_view` as a suffix,
    in order to avoid confusion or name collisions
    with "views" in the sense of ranges.

* We specifically do not use the names `transpose` or `transpose_view`,
    since LEWG has advised us that ranges algorithms may want to claim these names.
    (One could imagine "transposing" a range of ranges.)

* We constrain our algorithms only to take vector and matrix parameters as `mdspan`.
    `mdspan` is not currently a range,
    and there are currently no proposals in flight that would make it a range.
    Changing `mdspan` of arbitrary rank to be a range
    would require a design for multidimensional iterators.
    P0009's coauthors have not proposed a design,
    and it has proven challenging to get compilers to optimize
    any existing design for multidimensional iterators.

### Minimal overlap with ranges is justified by user convenience

The rest of this section answers the second question.
The BLAS 2 and 3 algorithms require multiple nested loops,
and high-performing implementations generally need intermediate storage.
This would make it unnatural and difficult to express them in terms of ranges.
Only the BLAS 1 algorithms in our proposal
might have a reasonable translation to ranges algorithms.
There, we limit ourselves to the BLAS 1 algorithms in what follows.

Any rank-1 `mdspan` `x` can be translated into the following range:

```c++
auto x_range = views::iota(size_t(0), x.extent(0)) |
    views::transform([x] (auto k) { return x[k]; });
```

with specializations possible for `mdspan`
whose layout mapping's range
is a contiguous or fixed-stride set of offsets.
However, just because code _could_ be written in a certain way
doesn't mean that it _should_ be.
We have ranges even though the language has `for` loops;
we don't need to step in the Turing tar-pit on purpose
(see Perlis 1982).
Thus, we will analyze the BLAS 1 algorithms in this proposal
in the context of the previous section's four general criteria.

Our proposal would add 61 new unique names to the C++ Standard Library.
Of those, 16 are BLAS 1 algorithms, while 24 are BLAS 2 and 3 algorithms.
The 16 BLAS 1 algorithms fall into three categories:

1. Optimization hooks, like `copy`.  As with `memcpy`,
    the fastest implementation may depend closely on the computer architecture,
    and may differ significantly from a straightforward implementation.
    Some of these algorithms, like `copy`,
    can operate on multidimensional arrays as well,
    though it is traditional to list them as BLAS 1 algorithms.

2. Floating-point quality-of-implementation hooks, like `vector_sum_of_squares`.
    These give vendors opportunities
    to avoid preventable floating-point underflow and overflow
    (as with `hypot`),
    improve accuracy, and reduce or even avoid parallel nondeterminism
    and order dependence of floating-point sums.

3. Uncomplicated elementwise algorithms like `add`, `idx_abs_max`, and `scale`.

We included the first category mainly because of Criterion (2)
"Opportunity for vendors to provide hardware-specific optimizations,"
and the second mainly because of Criterion (3)
("Opportunity for vendors to provide quality-of-implementation improvements").
Fast implementations of algorithms in the first category
are not likely to be simple uses of ranges algorithms.

Algorithms in the second category could be presented as ranges algorithms,
as `mdspan` algorithms, or as both.
The "iterating over elements" part of those algorithms
is not the most challenging part of their implementation,
nor is it what makes an implementation "high quality."

Algorithms in the third category could be replaced
with a few lines of C++ that use ranges algorithms.
For example, here is a parallel implementation of `idx_abs_max`,
omitting constraints on template parameters for simplicity.
(Here is a <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/7eW9ExsKM">Compiler Explorer link</a>
to a working example.)

```c++
template<class Element, class Extents,
  class Layout, class Accessor>
typename Extents::size_type idx_abs_max(
  std::mdspan<Element, Extents, Layout, Accessor> x)
{
  auto theRange = std::views::iota(size_t(0), x.extent(0)) |
    std::views::transform([=] (auto k) { return std::abs(x[k]); });
  auto iterOfMax =
    std::max_element(std::execution::par_unseq, theRange.begin(), theRange.end());
  auto indexOfMax = std::ranges::distance(theRange.begin(), iterOfMax);
  // In GCC 12.1, the return type is __int128.
  return static_cast<typename Extents::size_type>(indexOfMax);
}
```

Even though the algorithms in the third category
could be implemented straightforwardly with ranges,
we provide them because of Criterion 4 ("User convenience").
Criterion (4) applies to all the algorithms in this proposal,
and particularly to the BLAS 1 algorithms.
Matrix algorithm developers need BLAS 1 and 2 as well as BLAS 3,
because matrix algorithms tend to decompose into vector algorithms.
This is true even of so-called "block" matrix algorithms
that have been optimized to use matrix-matrix operations wherever possible,
in order to improve memory locality.
Demmel et al. 1987 (p. 4) explains.

> Block algorithms generally require an unblocked version
> of the same algorithm to be available to operate on a single block.
> Therefore, the development of the software will fall naturally into two phases:
> first, develop unblocked versions of the routines,
> calling the Level 2 BLAS wherever possible;
> then develop blocked versions where possible,
> calling the Level 3 BLAS.

Dongarra et al. 1990 (pp. 12-15) outlines this development process
for the specific example of Cholesky factorization.
The Cholesky factorization algorithm (on p. 14)
spends most of its time (for a sufficiently large input matrix)
in matrix-matrix multiplies (`DGEMM`),
rank-k symmetric matrices updates
(`DSYRK`, a special case of matrix-matrix multiply),
and triangular solves with multiple "right-hand side" vectors (`DTRSM`).
However, it still needs an "unblocked" Cholesky factorization
as the blocked factorization's "base case."
This is called `DLLT` in Dongarra et al. 1990 (p. 15),
and it uses `DDOT`, `DSCAL` (both BLAS2), and `DGEMV` (BLAS 2).
In the case of Cholesky factorization,
it's possible to express the "unblocked" case without using BLAS 1 or 2 operations,
by using recursion.
This is the approach that LAPACK takes with the blocked Cholesky factorization
<a href="https://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d1/d7a/group__double_p_ocomputational_ga2f55f604a6003d03b5cd4a0adcfb74d6.html">`DPOTRF`</a>
and its unblocked base case
<a href="https://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d1/d7a/group__double_p_ocomputational_gad0718d061dc53c8b0fec6dc3710fab33.html">`DPOTRF2`</a>.
However, even a recursive formulation of most matrix factorizations
needs to use BLAS 1 or 2 operations.
For example, the unblocked base case
<a href="https://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/dd/d9a/group__double_g_ecomputational_gabdd3af29e9f6bbaf4b352341a1e8b464.html">`DGETRF2`</a>
of LAPACK's blocked LU factorization
<a href="https://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d3/d6a/dgetrf_8f_source.html">`DGETRF`</a>
needs to invoke vector-vector operations like `DSCAL`.

In summary, matrix algorithm developers need vector algorithms,
because matrix algorithms decompose into vector algorithms.
If our proposal lacked BLAS 1 algorithms,
even simple ones like `add` and `scale`,
matrix algorithm developers would end up writing them anyway.

# Notation and conventions

## The BLAS uses Fortran terms

The BLAS' "native" language is Fortran.  It has a C binding as well,
but the BLAS Standard and documentation use Fortran terms.  Where
applicable, we will call out relevant Fortran terms and highlight
possibly confusing differences with corresponding C++ ideas.  Our
paper <a href="https://wg21.link/p1674">P1674</a>
("Evolving a Standard C++ Linear Algebra Library from the BLAS")
goes into more detail on these issues.

## We call "subroutines" functions

Like Fortran, the BLAS distinguishes between functions that return a
value, and subroutines that do not return a value.  In what follows,
we will refer to both as "BLAS functions" or "functions."

## Element types and BLAS function name prefix

The BLAS implements functionality for four different matrix, vector,
or scalar element types:

* `REAL` (`float` in C++ terms)

* `DOUBLE PRECISION` (`double` in C++ terms)

* `COMPLEX` (`complex<float>` in C++ terms)

* `DOUBLE COMPLEX` (`complex<double>` in C++ terms)

The BLAS' Fortran 77 binding uses a function name prefix to
distinguish functions based on element type:

* `S` for `REAL` ("single")

* `D` for `DOUBLE PRECISION`

* `C` for `COMPLEX`

* `Z` for `DOUBLE COMPLEX`

For example, the four BLAS functions `SAXPY`, `DAXPY`, `CAXPY`, and
`ZAXPY` all perform the vector update `Y = Y + ALPHA*X` for vectors
`X` and `Y` and scalar `ALPHA`, but for different vector and scalar
element types.

The convention is to refer to all of these functions together as
`xAXPY`.  In general, a lower-case `x` is a placeholder for all data
type prefixes that the BLAS provides.  For most functions, the `x` is
a prefix, but for a few functions like `IxAMAX`, the data type
"prefix" is not the first letter of the function name.  (`IxAMAX` is a
Fortran function that returns `INTEGER`, and therefore follows the old
Fortran implicit naming rule that integers start with `I`, `J`, etc.)

Not all BLAS functions exist for all four data types.  These come in
three categories:

1. The BLAS provides only real-arithmetic (`S` and `D`) versions of
    the function, since the function only makes mathematical sense in
    real arithmetic.

2. The complex-arithmetic versions perform a slightly different
    mathematical operation than the real-arithmetic versions, so
    they have a different base name.

3. The complex-arithmetic versions offer a choice between
    nonconjugated or conjugated operations.

As an example of the second category, the BLAS functions `SASUM` and
`DASUM` compute the sums of absolute values of a vector's elements.
Their complex counterparts `CSASUM` and `DZASUM` compute the sums of
absolute values of real and imaginary components of a vector `v`, that
is, the sum of `abs(real(v[i])) + abs(imag(v[i]))` for all `i` in the
domain of `v`.  The latter operation is still useful as a vector norm,
but it requires fewer arithmetic operations.

Examples of the third category include the following:

* nonconjugated dot product `xDOTU` and conjugated dot product
    `xDOTC`; and

* rank-1 symmetric (`xGERU`) vs. Hermitian (`xGERC`) matrix update.

The conjugate transpose and the (nonconjugated) transpose are the
same operation in real arithmetic (if one considers real arithmetic
embedded in complex arithmetic), but differ in complex arithmetic.
Different applications have different reasons to want either.  The C++
Standard includes complex numbers, so a Standard linear algebra
library needs to respect the mathematical structures that go along
with complex numbers.

# What we exclude from the design

## Most functions not in the Reference BLAS

The BLAS Standard includes functionality that appears neither in the
[Reference BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d1/df9/group__blas.html)
library, nor in the classic BLAS "level" 1, 2, and 3 papers.  (For
history of the BLAS "levels" and a bibliography, see P1417R0.
For a paper describing functions not in the Reference BLAS,
see "An updated set of basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS),"
listed in "Other references" below.)
For example, the BLAS Standard has

* several new dense functions, like a fused vector update and dot
    product;
* sparse linear algebra functions, like sparse matrix-vector multiply
    and an interface for constructing sparse matrices; and
* extended- and mixed-precision dense functions (though we subsume
    some of their functionality; see below).

Our proposal only includes core Reference BLAS functionality, for the
following reasons:

1. Vendors who implement a new component of the C++ Standard Library
    will want to see and test against an existing reference
    implementation.

2. Many applications that use sparse linear algebra also use dense,
    but not vice versa.

3. The Sparse BLAS interface is a stateful interface that is not
    consistent with the dense BLAS, and would need more extensive
    redesign to translate into a modern C++ idiom.
    See discussion in P1417R0.

4. Our proposal subsumes some dense mixed-precision functionality (see
    below).

We have included vector sum-of-squares and matrix norms as exceptions,
for the same reason that we include vector 2-norm:
to expose hooks for quality-of-implementation improvements
that avoid underflow or overflow when computing with floating-point values.

## LAPACK or related functionality

The <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> Fortran library implements
solvers for the following classes of mathematical problems:

* linear systems,
* linear least-squares problems, and
* eigenvalue and singular value problems.

It also provides matrix factorizations and related linear algebra
operations.  LAPACK deliberately relies on the BLAS for good
performance; in fact, LAPACK and the BLAS were designed together.  See
history presented in P1417R0.

Several C++ libraries provide slices of LAPACK functionality.  Here is
a brief, noninclusive list, in alphabetical order, of some libraries
actively being maintained:

* [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/),
* [Boost.uBLAS](https://github.com/boostorg/ublas),
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page),
* [Matrix Template Library](http://www.simunova.com/de/mtl4/), and
* [Trilinos](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/).

<a href="https://wg21.link/p1417r0">P1417R0</a> gives some history of C++ linear
algebra libraries.  The authors of this proposal have
[designed](https://www.icl.utk.edu/files/publications/2017/icl-utk-1031-2017.pdf),
[written](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels), and
[maintained](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/tree/master/packages/teuchos/numerics/src)
LAPACK wrappers in C++.  Some authors have LAPACK founders as PhD
advisors.  Nevertheless, we have excluded LAPACK-like functionality
from this proposal, for the following reasons:

1. LAPACK is a Fortran library, unlike the BLAS, which is a
    multilanguage standard.

2. We intend to support more general element types, beyond the four
    that LAPACK supports.  It's much more straightforward to make a C++
    BLAS work for general element types, than to make LAPACK algorithms
    work generically.

First, unlike the BLAS, LAPACK is a Fortran library, not a standard.
LAPACK was developed concurrently with the "level 3" BLAS functions,
and the two projects share contributors.  Nevertheless, only the BLAS
and not LAPACK got standardized.  Some vendors supply LAPACK
implementations with some optimized functions, but most
implementations likely depend heavily on "reference" LAPACK.  There
have been a few efforts by LAPACK contributors to develop C++ LAPACK
bindings, from [Lapack++](https://math.nist.gov/lapack++/) in
pre-templates C++ circa 1993, to the recent ["C++ API for BLAS and
LAPACK"](https://www.icl.utk.edu/files/publications/2017/icl-utk-1031-2017.pdf).
(The latter shares coauthors with this proposal.)  However, these are
still just C++ bindings to a Fortran library.  This means that if
vendors had to supply C++ functionality equivalent to LAPACK, they
would either need to start with a Fortran compiler, or would need to
invest a lot of effort in a C++ reimplementation.  Mechanical
translation from Fortran to C++ introduces risk, because many LAPACK
functions depend critically on details of floating-point arithmetic
behavior.

Second, we intend to permit use of matrix or vector element types
other than just the four types that the BLAS and LAPACK support.  This
includes "short" floating-point types, fixed-point types, integers,
and user-defined arithmetic types.  Doing this is easier for BLAS-like
operations than for the much more complicated numerical algorithms in
LAPACK.  LAPACK strives for a "generic" design (see Jack Dongarra
interview summary in P1417R0), but only supports
two real floating-point types and two complex floating-point types.
Directly translating LAPACK source code into a "generic" version could
lead to pitfalls.  Many LAPACK algorithms only make sense for number
systems that aim to approximate real numbers (or their complex
extentions).  Some LAPACK functions output error bounds that rely on
properties of floating-point arithmetic.

For these reasons, we have left LAPACK-like functionality for future
work.  It would be natural for a future LAPACK-like C++ library to
build on our proposal.

## Extended-precision BLAS

Our interface subsumes some functionality of the Mixed-Precision BLAS
specification (Chapter 4 of the BLAS Standard).  For example, users
may multiply two 16-bit floating-point matrices (assuming that a
16-bit floating-point type exists) and accumulate into a 32-bit
floating-point matrix, just by providing a 32-bit floating-point
matrix as output.  Users may specify the precision of a dot product
result.  If it is greater than the input vectors' element type
precisions (e.g., `double` vs. `float`), then this effectively
performs accumulation in higher precision.  Our proposal imposes
semantic requirements on some functions, like `vector_norm2`, to
behave in this way.

However, we do not include the "Extended-Precision BLAS" in this
proposal.  The BLAS Standard lets callers decide at run time whether
to use extended precision floating-point arithmetic for internal
evaluations.  We could support this feature at a later time.
Implementations of our interface also have the freedom to use more
accurate evaluation methods than typical BLAS implementations.  For
example, it is possible to make floating-point sums completely
[independent of parallel evaluation
order](https://bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/reproblas/).

## Arithmetic operators and associated expression templates

Our proposal omits arithmetic operators on matrices and vectors.
We do so for the following reasons:

1. We propose a low-level, minimal interface.

2. `operator*` could have multiple meanings for matrices and vectors.
    Should it mean elementwise product (like `valarray`) or matrix
    product?  Should libraries reinterpret "vector times vector" as a
    dot product (row vector times column vector)?  We prefer to let a
    higher-level library decide this, and make everything explicit at
    our lower level.

3. Arithmetic operators require defining the element type of the
    vector or matrix returned by an expression.  Functions let users
    specify this explicitly, and even let users use different output
    types for the same input types in different expressions.

4. Arithmetic operators may require allocation of temporary matrix or
    vector storage.  This prevents use of nonowning data structures.

5. Arithmetic operators strongly suggest expression templates.  These
    introduce problems such as dangling references and aliasing.

Our goal is to propose a low-level interface.  Other libraries, such
as that proposed by <a href="https://wg21.link/p1385r6">P1385R6</a>, could use our
interface to implement overloaded arithmetic for matrices and vectors.
A constrained, function-based, BLAS-like
interface builds incrementally on the many years of BLAS experience.

Arithmetic operators on matrices and vectors would require the
library, not necessarily the user, to specify the element type of an
expression's result.  This gets tricky if the terms have mixed element
types.  For example, what should the element type of the result of the
vector sum `x + y` be, if `x` has element type `complex<float>` and
`y` has element type `double`?  It's tempting to use `common_type_t`,
but `common_type_t<complex<float>, double>` is `complex<float>`.  This
loses precision.  Some users may want `complex<double>`; others may
want `complex<long double>` or something else, and others may want to
choose different types in the same program.

P1385R6 lets users customize the return type
of such arithmetic expressions.  However, different algorithms may
call for the same expression with the same inputs to have different
output types.  For example, iterative refinement of linear systems
`Ax=b` can work either with an extended-precision intermediate
residual vector `r = b - A*x`, or with a residual vector that has the
same precision as the input linear system.  Each choice produces a
different algorithm with different convergence characteristics,
per-iteration run time, and memory requirements.  Thus, our library
lets users specify the result element type of linear algebra
operations explicitly, by calling a named function that takes an
output argument explicitly, rather than an arithmetic operator.

Arithmetic operators on matrices or vectors may also need to allocate
temporary storage.  Users may not want that.  When LAPACK's developers
switched from Fortran 77 to a subset of Fortran 90, their users
rejected the option of letting LAPACK functions allocate temporary
storage on their own.  Users wanted to control memory allocation.
Also, allocating storage precludes use of nonowning input data
structures like `mdspan`, that do not know how to allocate.

Arithmetic expressions on matrices or vectors strongly suggest
expression templates, as a way to avoid allocation of temporaries and
to fuse computational kernels.  They do not *require* expression
templates.  For example, `valarray` offers overloaded operators for
vector arithmetic, but the Standard lets implementers decide whether
to use expression templates.  However, all of the current C++ linear
algebra libraries that we mentioned above have some form of expression
templates for overloaded arithmetic operators, so users will expect
this and rely on it for good performance.  This was, indeed, one of
the major complaints about initial implementations of `valarray`: its
lack of mandate for expression templates meant that initial
implementations were slow, and thus users did not want to rely on it.
(See Josuttis 1999, p. 547, and Vandevoorde and Josuttis 2003, p. 342,
for a summary of the history.  Fortran has an analogous issue, in
which (under certain conditions) it is implementation defined whether
the run-time environment needs to copy noncontiguous slices of an
array into contiguous temporary storage.)

Expression templates work well, but have issues.  Our papers
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1417r0">P1417R0</a> and
"Evolving a Standard C++ Linear Algebra Library from the BLAS"
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1674">(P1674)</a>
give more detail on these concerns.
A particularly troublesome one is that C++ `auto` type deduction
makes it easy for users to capture expressions
before the expression templates system
has the chance to evaluate them and write the result into the output.
For matrices and vectors with container semantics,
this makes it easy to create dangling references.
Users might not realize that they need to assign expressions to named
types before actual work and storage happen.  [Eigen's
documentation](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicPitfalls.html)
describes this common problem.

Our `scaled`, `conjugated`, `transposed`, and `conjugate_transposed` functions
make use of one aspect of expression templates, namely modifying the
`mdspan` array access operator.  However, we intend these
functions for use only as in-place modifications of arguments of a
function call.  Also, when modifying `mdspan`, these functions
merely view the same data that their input `mdspan` views.  They
introduce no more potential for dangling references than
`mdspan` itself.  The use of views like `mdspan` is
self-documenting; it tells users that they need to take responsibility
for scope of the viewed data.

## Banded matrix layouts

This proposal omits banded matrix types.  It would be easy to add the
required layouts and specializations of algorithms later.  The packed
and unpacked symmetric and triangular layouts in this proposal cover
the major concerns that would arise in the banded case, like
nonstrided and nonunique layouts, and matrix types that forbid access
to some multi-indices in the Cartesian product of extents.

## Tensors

We exclude tensors from this proposal, for the following reasons.
First, tensor libraries naturally build on optimized dense linear
algebra libraries like the BLAS, so a linear algebra library is a good
first step.  Second, `mdspan` has natural use as a
low-level representation of dense tensors, so we are already partway
there.  Third, even simple tensor operations that naturally generalize
the BLAS have infintely many more cases than linear algebra.  It's not
clear to us which to optimize.  Fourth, even though linear algebra is
a special case of tensor algebra, users of linear algebra have
different interface expectations than users of tensor algebra.  Thus,
it makes sense to have two separate interfaces.

## Explicit support for asynchronous return of scalar values

After we presented revision 2 of this paper,
LEWG asked us to consider support for discrete graphics processing units (GPUs).
GPUs have two features of interest here.
First, they might have memory that is not accessible from ordinary C++ code,
but could be accessed in a standard algorithm
(or one of our proposed algorithms)
with the right implementation-specific `ExecutionPolicy`.
(For instance, a policy could say "run this algorithm on the GPU.")
Second, they might execute those algorithms asynchronously.
That is, they might write to output arguments at some later time
after the algorithm invocation returns.
This would imply different interfaces in some cases.
For instance, a hypothetical asynchronous vector 2-norm
might write its scalar result via a pointer to GPU memory,
instead of returning the result "on the CPU."

Nothing in principle prevents `mdspan` from viewing memory
that is inaccessible from ordinary C++ code.
This is a major feature of the `Kokkos::View` class
from the [Kokkos library](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos),
and `Kokkos::View` directly inspired `mdspan`.
The C++ Standard does not currently define how such memory behaves,
but implementations could define its behavior and make it work with `mdspan`.
This would, in turn, let implementations define our algorithms
to operate on such memory efficiently,
if given the right implementation-specific `ExecutionPolicy`.

Our proposal excludes algorithms that might write to their output arguments
at some time after after the algorithm returns.
First, LEWG insisted that our proposed algorithms that compute a scalar result,
like `vector_norm2`,
return that result in the manner of `reduce`,
rather than writing the result to an output reference or pointer.
(Previous revisions of our proposal used the latter interface pattern.)
Second, it's not clear whether writing a scalar result to a pointer
is the right interface for asynchronous algorithms.
Follow-on proposals to [Executors (P0443R14)](https://wg21.link/p0443R14)
include asynchronous algorithms,
but none of these suggest returning results asynchronously by pointer.
Our proposal deliberately imitates the existing standard algorithms.
Right now, we have no standard asynchronous algorithms to imitate.

# Design justification

We take a step-wise approach.  We begin with core BLAS dense linear
algebra functionality.  We then deviate from that only as much as
necessary to get algorithms that behave as much as reasonable like the
existing C++ Standard Library algorithms.  Future work or
collaboration with other proposals could implement a higher-level
interface.

Please refer to our papers
"Evolving a Standard C++ Linear Algebra Library from the BLAS"
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1674">(P1674)</a>
and "Historical lessons for C++ linear algebra library standardization"
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1417">(P1417)</a>
They will give details and references
for many of the points that we summarize here.

## We do not require using the BLAS library or any particular "back-end"

Our proposal is inspired by and extends the dense BLAS interface.
A natural implementation might look like this:

1. wrap an existing C or Fortran BLAS library,

2. hope that the BLAS library is optimized, and then

3. extend the wrapper to include straightforward
    Standard C++ implementations of P1673's algorithms
    for matrix and vector value types and data layouts
    that the BLAS does not support.

P1674 describes the process of writing such an implementation.
However, P1673 does not require implementations to wrap the BLAS.
In particular, P1673 does not specify a "back-end" C-style interface
that would let users or implementers "swap out" different BLAS libraries.
Here are some reasons why we made this choice.

First, it's possible to write an optimized implementation
entirely in Standard C++, without calling external C or Fortran functions.
For example, one can write a cache-blocked
matrix-matrix multiply implementationen entirely in Standard C++.

Second, different vendors may have their own libraries
that support matrix and vector value types and/or layouts
beyond what the standard dense BLAS supports.
For example, they may have C functions
for mixed-precision matrix-matrix multiply, like
BLIS' `bli_gemm`
<a href="https://github.com/flame/blis/blob/master/examples/oapi/11gemm_md.c">(example here)</a>,
or NVIDIA's `cublasGemmEx`
<a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/index.html#cublas-GemmEx">(example here)</a>.

Third, just because a C or Fortran BLAS library can be found,
doesn't mean that it's optimized at all or optimized well.
For example, many Linux distributions have a BLAS software package
that is built by compiling the Reference BLAS.
This will give poor performance for BLAS 3 operations.
Even "optimized" vendor BLAS libraries may not optimize all cases.
Release notes even for recent versions show performance improvements.

In summary: While a natural way to implement this proposal
would be to wrap an existing C or Fortran BLAS library,
we do not want to require this.
Thus, we do not specify a "back-end" C-style interface.

## Why use `mdspan`?

### View of a multidimensional array

The BLAS operates on what C++ programmers might call views of multidimensional arrays.
Users of the BLAS can store their data in whatever data structures they like,
and handle their allocation and lifetime as they see fit,
as long as the data have a BLAS-compatible memory layout.

The corresponding C++ data structure is `mdspan`.
This class encapsulates the large number of pointer and integer arguments
that BLAS functions take, that represent views of matrices and vectors.
Using `mdspan` in the C++ interface reduce the number of arguments
and avoids common errors, like mixing up the order of arguments.
It supports all the array memory layouts that the BLAS supports,
including row major and column major.
It also expresses the same data ownership model that the BLAS expresses.
Users may manage allocation and deallocation however they wish.
In addition, `mdspan` lets our algorithms exploit any dimensions known at compile time.

### Ease of use

The `mdspan` class' layout and accessor policies
let us simplify our interfaces,
by encapsulating transpose, conjugate, and scalar arguments.
Features of `mdspan` make implementing BLAS-like algorithms
much less error prone and easier to read.
These include its encapsulation of matrix indexing
and its built-in "slicing" capabilities via `submdspan`.

### BLAS and `mdspan` are low level

The BLAS is low level; it imposes no mathematical meaning on multidimensional arrays.
This gives users the freedom to develop mathematical libraries with the semantics they want.
Similarly, `mdspan` is just a view of a multidimensional array;
it has no mathematical meaning on its own.

We mention this because "matrix," "vector," and "tensor"
are mathematical ideas that mean more than just arrays of numbers.
This is more than just a theoretical concern.
Some BLAS functions operate on "triangular," "symmetric," or "Hermitian" matrices,
but they do not assert that a matrix has any of these mathematical properties.
Rather, they only read only one side of the matrix (the lower or upper triangle),
and compute as if the other side of the matrix satisfies the mathematical property.
A key feature of the BLAS and libraries that build on it, like LAPACK,
is that they can operate on the matrix's data in place.
These operations change both the matrix's mathematical properties and its representation in memory.
For example, one might have an N x N array representing a matrix that is symmetric in theory,
but computed and stored in a way that might not result in exactly symmetric data.
In order to solve linear systems with this matrix,
one might give the array to LAPACK's `xSYTRF` to compute an $L D L^T$ factorization,
asking `xSYTRF` only to access the array's lower triangle.
If `xSYTRF` finishes successfully,
it has overwritten the lower triangle of its input
with a representation of both the lower triangular factor L
and the block diagonal matrix D,
as computed assuming that the matrix is the sum of the lower triangle
and the transpose of the lower triangle.
The resulting N x N array no longer represents a symmetric matrix.
Rather, it contains part of the representation of a $L D L^T$ factorization of the matrix.
The upper triangle still contains the original input matrix's data.
One may then solve linear systems by giving `xSYTRS` the lower triangle,
along with other output of `xSYTRF`.

The point of this example is that a "symmetric matrix class"
is the wrong way to model this situation.
There's an N x N array, whose mathematical interpretation changes
with each in-place operation performed on it.
The low-level `mdspan` data structure carries no mathematical properties in itself,
so it models this situation better.

### Hook for future expansion

The `mdspan` class treats its layout as an extension point.
This lets our interface support layouts beyond what the BLAS Standard permits.
The accessor extension point offers us a hook for future expansion
to support heterogeneous memory spaces.
(This is a key feature of `Kokkos::View`,
the data structure that inspired `mdspan`.)
In addition, using `mdspan` will make it easier for us to add
an efficient "batched" interface in future proposals.

### Generic enough to replace a "multidimensional array concept"

LEWGI requested in the 2019 Cologne meeting that we explore using a
concept instead of `mdspan` to define the arguments for the
linear algebra functions.
This would mean that instead of having our functions take `mdspan` parameters,
they would be generic on one or more suitably constrained multidimensional array types.
The constraints would form a "multidimensional array concept."

We investigated this option, and rejected it, for the following reasons.

1. Our proposal uses enough features of `mdspan`
    that any concept generally applicable to all functions we propose
    would largely replicate the definition of `mdspan`.

2. This proposal could support most multidimensional array types,
    if the array types just made themselves convertible to `mdspan`.

3. We could always generalize our algorithms later.

4. Any multidimensional array concept would need revision
    in the light of <a href="https://wg21.link/p2128r6">P2128R6</a>.

This proposal refers to almost all of `mdspan`'s features,
including `extents`, layouts, and accessors.
We expect implementations to use all of them for optimizations,
for example to extract the scaling factor from the return value of `scaled`
in order to call an optimized BLAS library directly.

Suppose that a general customization point `get_mdspan` exists,
that takes a reference to a multidimensional array type
and returns an `mdspan` that views the array.
Then, our proposal could support most multidimensional array types.
"Most" includes all such types that refer to a subset of a contiguous span of memory.

Requiring that a multidimensional array refer to a subset of a contiguous span of memory
would exclude multidimensional array types that have a noncontiguous backing store,
such as a `map`.
If we later wanted to support such types,
we could always generalize our algorithms later.

Finally, any existing multidimensional array concept would need revision
in the light of <a href="https://wg21.link/p2128r6">P2128R6</a>,
which has been voted into the C++ Standard draft.
P2128 lets `operator[]` take multiple parameters.
The version of mdspan which was voted into the C++ Standard draft
uses `operator[]` instead of `operator()` as the array access operator.

After further discussion at the 2019 Belfast meeting,
LEWGI accepted our position that having our algorithms take `mdspan`
instead of template parameters constrained by a multidimensional array concept
would be fine for now.

## Function argument aliasing and zero scalar multipliers

Summary:

1. The BLAS Standard forbids aliasing any input (read-only) argument
    with any output (write-only or read-and-write) argument.

2. The BLAS uses `INTENT(INOUT)` (read-and-write) arguments to express
    "updates" to a vector or matrix.  By contrast, C++ Standard
    algorithms like `transform` take input and output iterator ranges
    as different parameters, but may let input and output ranges be the
    same.

3. The BLAS uses the values of scalar multiplier arguments ("alpha" or
    "beta") of vectors or matrices at run time, to decide whether to
    treat the vectors or matrices as write only.  This matters both for
    performance and semantically, assuming IEEE floating-point
    arithmetic.

4. We decide separately, based on the category of BLAS function, how
    to translate `INTENT(INOUT)` arguments into a C++ idiom:

   a. For triangular solve and triangular multiply, in-place behavior
      is essential for computing matrix factorizations in place,
      without requiring extra storage proportional to the input
      matrix's dimensions.  However, in-place functions may hinder
      implementations' use of some forms of parallelism.
      Thus, we have both not-in-place and in-place overloads.
      Both take an optional `ExecutionPolicy&&`,
      as some forms of parallelism (e.g., vectorization)
      may still be effective with in-place operations.

   b. Else, if the BLAS function unconditionally updates (like
      `xGER`), we retain read-and-write behavior for that argument.

   c. Else, if the BLAS function uses a scalar `beta` argument to
      decide whether to read the output argument as well as write to
      it (like `xGEMM`), we provide two versions: a write-only version
      (as if `beta` is zero), and a read-and-write version (as if
      `beta` is nonzero).

"Evolving a Standard C++ Linear Algebra Library from the BLAS"

## Support for different matrix layouts

Summary:

1. The dense BLAS supports several different dense matrix "types."
    Type is a mixture of "storage format" (e.g., packed, banded) and
    "mathematical property" (e.g., symmetric, Hermitian, triangular).

2. Some "types" can be expressed as custom `mdspan` layouts.
    Other types actually represent algorithmic constraints: for
    instance, what entries of the matrix the algorithm is allowed to
    access.

3. Thus, a C++ BLAS wrapper cannot overload on matrix "type" simply by
    overloading on `mdspan` specialization.  The wrapper must use
    different function names, tags, or some other way to decide what
    the matrix type is.

For more details, including a list and description of the matrix
"types" that the dense BLAS supports, please see our paper
"Evolving a Standard C++ Linear Algebra Library from the BLAS"
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1674">(P1674)</a>.

A C++ linear algebra library has a few possibilities for
distinguishing the matrix "type":

1. It could imitate the BLAS, by introducing different function names,
    if the layouts and accessors do not sufficiently describe the
    arguments.

2. It could introduce a hierarchy of higher-level classes for
    representing linear algebra objects, use `mdspan` (or
    something like it) underneath, and write algorithms to those
    higher-level classes.

3. It could use the layout and accessor types in `mdspan` simply
    as tags to indicate the matrix "type."  Algorithms could specialize
    on those tags.

We have chosen Approach 1.  Our view is that a BLAS-like interface
should be as low-level as possible.  Approach 2 is more like a "Matlab
in C++"; a library that implements this could build on our proposal's
lower-level library.  Approach 3 *sounds* attractive.  However, most
BLAS matrix "types" do not have a natural representation as layouts.
Trying to hack them in would pollute `mdspan` -- a simple class
meant to be easy for the compiler to optimize -- with extra baggage
for representing what amounts to sparse matrices.  We think that BLAS
matrix "type" is better represented with a higher-level library that
builds on our proposal.

## Interpretation of "lower / upper triangular"

### Triangle refers to what part of the matrix is accessed

The triangular, symmetric, and Hermitian algorithms in this proposal
all take a `Triangle` tag that specifies whether the algorithm
should access the upper or lower triangle of the matrix.
This has the same function as the `UPLO` argument
of the corresponding BLAS routines.
The upper or lower triangular argument
only refers to what part of the matrix the algorithm will access.
The "other triangle" of the matrix need not contain useful data.
For example, with the symmetric algorithms,
`A[j, i]` need not equal `A[i, j]`
for any `i` and `j` in the domain of `A` with `i` not equal to `j`.
The algorithm just accesses one triangle and interprets the other triangle
as the result of flipping the accessed triangle over the diagonal.

This "interpretation" approach to representing triangular matrices
is critical for matrix factorizations.
For example, LAPACK's LU factorization (`xGETRF`)
overwrites a matrix A with both its L (lower triangular,
implicitly represented diagonal of all ones)
and U (upper triangular, explicitly stored diagonal) factors.
Solving linear systems Ax=b with this factorization,
as LAPACK's `xGETRS` routine does,
requires solving first a linear system with the upper triangular matrix U,
and then solving a linear system with the lower triangular matrix L.
If the BLAS required that the "other triangle"
of a triangular matrix had all zero elements,
then LU factorization would require at least twice the storage.
For symmetric and Hermitian matrices,
only accessing the matrix's elements nonredundantly
ensures that the matrix remains mathematically symmetric resp. Hermitian,
even in the presence of rounding error.

### BLAS applies UPLO to original matrix; we apply Triangle to transformed matrix

The BLAS routines that take an `UPLO` argument
generally also take a `TRANS` argument.
The `TRANS` argument says whether to apply the matrix,
its transpose, or its conjugate transpose.
The BLAS applies the `UPLO` argument to the "original" matrix,
not to the transposed matrix.
For example, if `TRANS='T'` or `TRANS='C'`,
`UPLO='U'` means the routine will access the upper triangle of the matrix,
not the upper triangle of the matrix's transpose.

Our proposal takes the opposite approach.
It applies `Triangle` to the input matrix,
which may be the result of a transformation
such as `transposed` or `conjugate_transposed`.
For example, if `Triangle` is `upper_triangle_t`,
the algorithm will always access the matrix
for `i,j` in its domain with `i` ≤ `j`
(or `i` strictly less than `j`,
if the algorithm takes a `Diagonal` tag
and `Diagonal` is `implicit_unit_diagonal_t`).
If the input matrix is `transposed(A)` for a `layout_left` `mdspan` `A`,
this means that the algorithm will access the upper triangle of `transposed(A)`,
which is actually the *lower* triangle of `A`.

We took this approach because our interface permits arbitrary layouts,
with possibly arbitrary nesting of layout transformations.
This comes from `mdspan`'s design itself, not even necessarily from our proposal.
For example, users might define `antitranspose(A)`,
that flips indices over the antidiagonal
(the "other diagonal" that goes from the lower left to the upper right of the matrix,
instead of from the upper left to the lower right).
Layout transformations need not even be one-to-one,
because layouts themselves need not be (hence `is_unique`).
Since it's not possible to "undo" a general layout,
there's no way to get back to the "original matrix."

Our approach, while not consistent with the BLAS, is internally consistent.
`Triangle` always has a clear meaning,
no matter what transformations users apply to the input.
Layout transformations like `transposed`
have the same interpretation for all the matrix algorithms,
whether for general, triangular, symmetric, or Hermitian matrices.
This interpretation is consistent with the standard meaning of `mdspan` layouts.

C BLAS implementations already apply layout transformations like this
so that they can use an existing column-major Fortran BLAS
to implement operations on matrices with different layouts.
For example, the transpose of an `M` x `N` `layout_left` matrix
is just the same data, viewed as an `N` x `M` `layout_right` matrix.
Thus, `transposed` is consistent with current practice.
In fact, `transposed` need not use a special `layout_transpose`,
if it knows how to reinterpret the input layout.

### Summary

1. BLAS applies `UPLO` to the original matrix, before any transposition.
    Our proposal applies `Triangle` to the transformed matrix,
    after any transposition.

2. Our approach is the only reasonable way to handle the full generality
    of user-defined layouts and layout transformations.

## Over- and underflow wording for vector 2-norm

SG6 recommended to us at Belfast 2019 to change the special overflow /
underflow wording for `vector_norm2` to imitate the BLAS Standard more
closely.  The BLAS Standard does say something about overflow and
underflow for vector 2-norms.  We reviewed this wording and conclude
that it is either a nonbinding quality of implementation (QoI)
recommendation, or too vaguely stated to translate directly into C++
Standard wording.
Thus, we removed our special overflow / underflow wording.
However, the BLAS Standard clearly expresses the intent
that implementations document their underflow and overflow guarantees
for certain functions, like vector 2-norms.
The C++ Standard requires documentation of "implementation-defined behavior."
Therefore, we added language to our proposal that makes
"any guarantees regarding overflow and underflow" of those certain functions
"implementation-defined."

Previous versions of this paper asked implementations to compute
vector 2-norms "without undue overflow or underflow at intermediate
stages of the computation."  "Undue" imitates existing C++ Standard
wording for `hypot`.  This wording hints at the stricter requirements
in F.9 (normative, but optional) of the C Standard for math library
functions like `hypot`, without mandating those requirements.  In
particular, paragraph 9 of F.9 says:

> Whether or when library functions raise an undeserved "underflow"
> floating-point exception is unspecified.  Otherwise, as implied by
> F.7.6, the **&lt;math.h&gt;** functions do not raise spurious
> floating-point exceptions (detectable by the user) [including the
> "overflow" exception discussed in paragraph 6], other than the
> "inexact" floating-point exception.

However, these requirements are for math library functions like
`hypot`, not for general algorithms that return floating-point values.
SG6 did not raise a concern that we should treat `vector_norm2` like a
math library function; their concern was that we imitate the BLAS
Standard's wording.

The BLAS Standard says of several operations, including vector 2-norm:
"Here are the exceptional routines where we ask for particularly
careful implementations to avoid unnecessary over/underflows, that
could make the output unnecessarily inaccurate or unreliable" (p. 35).

The BLAS Standard does not define phrases like "unnecessary
over/underflows."  The likely intent is to avoid naïve implementations
that simply add up the squares of the vector elements.  These would
overflow even if the norm in exact arithmetic is significantly less
than the overflow threshold.  The POSIX Standard (IEEE Std
1003.1-2017) analogously says that `hypot` must "take precautions
against overflow during intermediate steps of the computation."

The phrase "precautions against overflow" is too vague for us to
translate into a requirement.  The authors likely meant to exclude
naïve implementations, but not require implementations to know whether
a result computed in exact arithmetic would overflow or underflow.
The latter is a special case of computing floating-point sums exactly,
which is costly for vectors of arbitrary length.  While it would be a
useful feature, it is difficult enough that we do not want to require
it, especially since the BLAS Standard itself does not.
The implementation of vector 2-norms in the Reference BLAS included with LAPACK 3.10.0
partitions the running sum of squares into three different accumulators:
one for big values (that might cause the sum to overflow without rescaling),
one for small values (that might cause the sum to underflow without rescaling),
and one for the remaining "medium" values.
(See Anderson 2017.)
Earlier implementations merely rescaled by the current maximum absolute value
of all the vector entries seen thus far.
(See Blue 1978.)
Implementations could also just compute the sum of squares in a straightforward loop,
then check floating-point status flags for underflow or overflow,
and recompute if needed.

For all of the functions listed on p. 35 of the BLAS Standard as
needing "particularly careful implementations," *except* vector norm,
the BLAS Standard has an "Advice to implementors" section with extra
accuracy requirements.  The BLAS Standard does have an "Advice to
implementors" section for matrix norms (see Section 2.8.7, p. 69),
which have similar over- and underflow concerns as vector norms.
However, the Standard merely states that "[h]igh-quality
implementations of these routines should be accurate" and should
document their accuracy, and gives examples of "accurate
implementations" in LAPACK.

The BLAS Standard never defines what "Advice to implementors" means.
However, the BLAS Standard shares coauthors and audience with the
Message Passing Interface (MPI) Standard, which defines "Advice to
implementors" as "primarily commentary to implementors" and
permissible to skip (see e.g., MPI 3.0, Section 2.1, p. 9).  We thus
interpret "Advice to implementors" in the BLAS Standard as a
nonbinding quality of implementation (QoI) recommendation.

## Constraining matrix and vector element types and scalars

### Introduction

The BLAS only accepts four different types of scalars and matrix and vector elements.
In C++ terms, these correspond to `float`, `double`, `complex<float>`, and `complex<double>`.
The algorithms we propose generalize the BLAS
by accepting any matrix, vector, or scalar element types that make sense for each algorithm.
Those may be built-in types, like floating-point numbers or integers,
or they may be custom types.
Those custom types might not behave like conventional real or complex numbers.
For example, quaternions have noncommutative multiplication (`a * b` might not equal `b * a`),
polynomials in one variable over a field lack division,
and some types might not even have subtraction defined.
Nevertheless, many BLAS operations would make sense for all of these types.

"Constraining matrix and vector element types and scalars"
means defining how these types must behave
in order for our algorithms to make sense.
This includes both syntactic and semantic constraints.
We have three goals:

1. to help implementers implement our algorithms correctly;

2. to give implementers the freedom to make quality of implementation (QoI) enhancements,
    for both performance and accuracy; and

3. to help users understand what types they may use with our algorithms.

The whole point of the BLAS was to identify key operations
for vendors to optimize.
Thus, performance is a major concern.
"Accuracy" here refers to either to rounding error or to approximation error
(for matrix or vector element types where either makes sense).

### Value type constraints do not suffice to describe algorithm behavior

LEWG's 2020 review of P1673R2 asked us to investigate conceptification of its algorithms.
"Conceptification" here refers to an effort like that of P1813R0
("A Concept Design for the Numeric Algorithms"),
to come up with concepts that could be used to constrain the template parameters
of numeric algorithms like `reduce` or `transform`.
(We are not referring to LEWGI's request for us to consider
generalizing our algorithm's parameters from `mdspan`
to a hypothetical multidimensional array concept.
We discuss that above, in the "Why use `mdspan`?" section.)
The numeric algorithms are relevant to P1673 because many of the algorithms proposed in P1673
look like generalizations of `reduce` or `transform`.
We intend for our algorithms to be generic on their matrix and vector element types,
so these questions matter a lot to us.

We agree that it is useful to set constraints
that make it possible to reason about correctness of algorithms.
However, we do not think constraints on value types suffice for this purpose.
First, requirements like associativity are too strict to be useful for practical types.
Second, what we really want to do is describe the behavior of algorithms,
regardless of value types' semantics.
"The algorithm may reorder sums" means something different
than "addition on the terms in the sum is associative."

### Associativity is too strict

P1813R0 requires associative addition for many algorithms, such as `reduce`.
However, many practical arithmetic systems that users might like to use
with algorithms like `reduce` have non-associative addition.  These include

* systems with rounding;

* systems with an "infinity": e.g., if 10 is Inf, 3 + 8 - 7 could be either Inf or 4; and

* saturating arithmetic: e.g., if 10 saturates, 3 + 8 - 7 could be either 3 or 4.

Note that the latter two arithmetic systems have nothing to do with rounding error.
With saturating integer arithmetic, parenthesizing a sum in different ways might give results
that differ by as much as the saturation threshold.
It's true that many non-associative arithmetic systems behave
"associatively enough" that users don't fear parallelizing sums.
However, a concept with an exact property (like "commutative semigroup")
isn't the right match for "close enough,"
just like `operator==` isn't the right match for describing "nearly the same."
For some number systems, a rounding error bound might be more appropriate,
or guarantees on when underflow or overflow may occur (as in POSIX's `hypot`).

The problem is a mismatch between the requirement we want to express --
that "the algorithm may reparenthesize addition" --
and the constraint that "addition is associative."
The former describes the algorithm's behavior,
while the latter describes the types used with that algorithm.
Given the huge variety of possible arithmetic systems,
an approach like the Standard's use of *GENERALIZED_SUM* to describe `reduce` and its kin seems more helpful.
If the Standard describes an algorithm in terms of *GENERALIZED_SUM*,
then that tells the caller what the algorithm might do.
The caller then takes responsibility for interpreting the algorithm's results.

We think this is important both for adding new algorithms (like those in this proposal)
and for defining behavior of an algorithm with respect to different `ExecutionPolicy` arguments.
(For instance, `execution::par_unseq` could imply that the algorithm might change the order of terms in a sum,
while `execution::par` need not.
Compare to `MPI_Op_create`'s `commute` parameter,
that affects the behavior of algorithms like `MPI_Reduce`
when used with the resulting user-defined reduction operator.)

### Generalizing associativity helps little

Suppose we accept that associativity and related properties are not useful
for describing our proposed algorithms.
Could there be a generalization of associativity that *would* be useful?
P1813R0's most general concept is a `magma`.
Mathematically, a *magma* is a set M with a binary operation ×,
such that if a and b are in M, then a × b is in M.
The operation need not be associative or commutative.
While this seems almost too general to be useful,
there are two reasons why even a magma is too specific for our proposal.

1. A magma only assumes one set, that is, one type.
    This does not accurately describe what the algorithms do,
    and it excludes useful features like mixed precision and types that use expression templates.

2. A magma is too specific, because algorithms are useful even if the binary operation is not closed.

First, even for simple linear algebra operations that "only" use plus and times,
there is no one "set M" over which plus and times operate.
There are actually three operations: plus, times, and assignment.
Each operation may have completely heterogeneous input(s) and output.
The sets (types) that may occur vary from algorithm to algorithm,
depending on the input type(s),
and the algebraic expression(s) that the algorithm is allowed to use.
We might need several different concepts to cover all the expressions that algorithms use,
and the concepts would end up being less useful to users than the expressions themselves.

For instance, consider the Level 1 BLAS "AXPY" function.
This computes `y[i] = alpha * x[i] + y[i]` elementwise.
What type does the expression `alpha * x[i] + y[i]` have?
It doesn't need to have the same type as `y[i]`;
it just needs to be assignable to `y[i]`.
The types of `alpha`, `x[i]`, and `y[i]` could all differ.
As a simple example, `alpha` might be `int`,
`x[i]` might be `float`, and `y[i]` might be `double`.
The types of `x[i]` and `y[i]` might be more complicated;
e.g., `x[i]` might be a polynomial with `double` coefficients,
and `y[i]` a polynomial with `float` coefficients.
If those polynomials use expression templates,
then slightly different sum expressions involving `x[i]` and/or `y[i]`
(e.g., `alpha * x[i] + y[i]`, `x[i] + y[i]`, or `y[i] + x[i]`)
might all have different types,
all of which differ from value type of `x` or `y`.
All of these types must be assignable and convertible to the output value type.

We could try to describe this with a concept that expresses a sum type.
The sum type would include all the types that might show up in the expression.
However, we do not think this would improve clarity over just the expression itself.
Furthermore, different algorithms may need different expressions,
so we would need multiple concepts, one for each expression.
Why not just use the expressions to describe what the algorithms can do?

Second, the magma concept is not helpful even if we only had one set M,
because our algorithms would still be useful even if binary operations were not closed over that set.
For example, consider a hypothetical user-defined rational number type,
where plus and times throw if representing the result of the operation
would take more than a given fixed amount of memory.
Programmers might handle this exception by falling back to different algorithms.
Neither plus or times on this type would satisfy the magma requirement,
but the algorithms would still be useful for such a type.
One could consider the magma requirement satisfied in a purely syntactic sense,
because of the return type of plus and times.
However, saying that would not accurately express the type's behavior.

This point returns us to the concerns we expressed earlier about assuming associativity.
"Approximately associative" or "usually associative" are not useful concepts without further refinement.
The way to refine these concepts usefully is to describe the behavior of a type fully,
e.g., the way that IEEE 754 describes the behavior of floating-point numbers.
However, algorithms rarely depend on all the properties in a specification like IEEE 754.
The problem, again, is that we need to describe
what algorithms do -- e.g., that they can rearrange terms in a sum -- not how the types
that go into the algorithms behave.

In summary:

* Many useful types have nonassociative or even non-closed arithmetic.

* Lack of (e.g.,) associativity is not just a rounding error issue.

* It can be useful to let algorithms do things like reparenthesize sums or products,
    even for types that are not associative.

* Permission for an algorithm to reparenthesize sums
    is not the same as a concept constraining the terms in the sum.

* We can and do use existing Standard language, like *GENERALIZED_SUM*,
    for expressing permissions that algorithms have.

In the sections that follow, we will describe a different way
to constrain the matrix and vector element types and scalars in our algorithms.
We will start by categorizing the different quality of implementation (QoI) enhancements
that implementers might like to make.
These enhancements call for changing algorithms in different ways.
We will distinguish textbook from non-textbook ways of changing algorithms,
explain that we only permit non-textbook changes for floating-point types,
then develop constraints on types that permit textbook changes.

### Categories of QoI enhancements

An important goal of constraining our algorithms is
to give implementers the freedom to make QoI enhancements.
We categorize QoI enhancements in three ways:

1. those that depend entirely on the computer architecture;

2. those that might have architecture-dependent parameters,
    but could otherwise be written in an architecture-independent way; and

3. those that diverge from a textbook description of the algorithm,
    and depend on element types having properties more specific
    than what that description requires.

An example of Category (1) would be special hardware instructions
that perform matrix-matrix multiplications on small, fixed-size blocks.
The hardware might only support a few types,
such as integers, fixed-point reals, or floating-point types.
Implementations might use these instructions for the entire algorithm,
if the problem sizes and element types match the instruction's requirements.
They might also use these instructions to solve subproblems.
In either case, these instructions might reorder sums
or create temporary values.

Examples of Category (2) include blocking
to increase cache or translation lookaside buffer (TLB) reuse,
or using SIMD instructions (given the Parallelism TS' inclusion of SIMD).
Many of these optimizations relate to memory locality or parallelism.
For an overview, see (Goto 2008) or Section 2.6 of (Demmel 1997).
All such optimizations reorder sums and create temporary values.

Examples of Category (3) include Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication.
The textbook formulation of matrix multiplication only uses additions and multiplies,
but Strassen's algorithm also performs subtractions.
A common feature of Category (3) enhancements
is that their implementation diverges
from a "textbook description of the algorithm"
in ways beyond just reordering sums.
As a "textbook," we recommend either (Strang 2016),
or the concise mathematical description of operations in the BLAS Standard.
In the next section, we will list properties of textbook descriptions,
and explain some ways in which QoI enhancements might fail to adhere to those properties.

### Properties of textbook algorithm descriptions

"Textbook descriptions" of the algorithms we propose
tend to have the following properties.
For each property, we give an example of a "non-textbook" algorithm,
and how it assumes something extra about the matrix's element type.

a. They compute floating-point sums straightforwardly
   (possibly reordered, or with temporary intermediate values),
   rather than using any of several algorithms that improve accuracy
   (e.g., compensated summation)
   or even make the result independent of evaluation order (see Demmel 2013).
   All such non-straightforward algorithms
   depend on properties of floating-point arithmetic.
   We will define below what "possibly reordered,
   or with temporary intermediate values" means.

b. They use only those arithmetic operations
   on the matrix and vector element types
   that the textbook description of the algorithm requires,
   even if using other kinds of arithmetic operations
   would improve performance
   or give an asymptotically faster algorithm.

c. They use exact algorithms (not considering rounding error),
   rather than approximations
   (that would not be exact even if computing with real numbers).

d. They do not use parallel algorithms
   that would give an asymptotically faster parallelization
   in the theoretical limit of infinitely many available parallel processing units,
   at the cost of likely unacceptable rounding error in floating-point arithmetic.

As an example of (b), the textbook matrix multiplication algorithm
only adds or multiplies the matrices' elements.
In contrast, Strassen's algorithm for matrix-matrix multiply
subtracts as well as adds and multiplies the matrices' elements.
Use of subtraction assumes that arbitrary elements have an additive inverse,
but the textbook matrix multiplication algorithm makes sense
even for element types that lack additive inverses for all elements.
Also, use of subtractions changes floating-point rounding behavior
in a way that was only fully understood recently (see Demmel 2007).

As an example of (c), the textbook substitution algorithm
for solving triangular linear systems is exact.
In contrast, one can approximate triangular solve with a stationary iteration.
(See, e.g., Section 5 of (Chow 2015).
That paper concerns the sparse matrix case;
we cite it merely as an example of an approximate algorithm,
not as a recommendation for dense triangular solve.)
Approximation only makes sense for element types
that have enough precision for the approximation to be accurate.
If the approximation checks convergence,
than the algorithm also requires less-than comparison
of absolute values of differences.

Multiplication by the reciprocal of a number,
rather than division by that number,
could fit into (b) or (c).
As an example of (c), implementations for hardware
where floating-point division is slow compared with multiplication
could use an approximate reciprocal multiplication to implement division.

As an example of (d), the textbook substitution algorithm
for solving triangular linear systems has data dependencies
that limit its theoretical parallelism.
In contrast, one can solve a triangular linear system
by building all powers of the matrix in parallel,
then solving the linear system as with a Krylov subspace method.
This approach is exact for real numbers,
but commits too much rounding error to be useful in practice
for all but the smallest linear systems.
In fact, the algorithm requires that the matrix's element type
have precision exponential in the matrix's dimension.

Many of these non-textbook algorithms rely on properties of floating-point arithmetic.
Strassen's algorithm makes sense for unsigned integer types,
but it could lead to unwarranted and unexpected overflow for signed integer types.
Thus, we think it best to limit implementers to textbook algorithms,
unless all matrix and vector element types are floating-point types.
We always forbid non-textbook algorithms of type (d).
If all matrix and vector element types are floating-point types,
we permit non-textbook algorithms of Types (a), (b), and (c),
under two conditions:

1. they satisfy the complexity requirements; and

2. they result in a *logarithmically stable* algorithm,
    in the sense of (Demmel 2007).

We believe that Condition (2) is a reasonable interpretation of Section 2.7 of the BLAS Standard.
This says that "no particular computational order is mandated by the function specifications.
In other words, any algorithm that produces results 'close enough'
to the usual algorithms presented in a standard book on matrix computations
is acceptable."
Examples of what the BLAS Standard considers "acceptable"
include Strassen's algorithm, and implementing matrix multiplication as
`C = (alpha * A) * B + (beta * C)`,
`C = alpha * (A * B) + (beta * C)`, or
`C = A * (alpha * B) + (beta * C)`.

"Textbook algorithms" includes optimizations commonly found in BLAS implementations.
This includes any available hardware acceleration,
as well as the locality and parallelism optimizations we describe below.
Thus, we think restricting generic implementations to textbook algorithms
will not overly limit implementers.

The set of floating-point types currently has three members:
`float`, `double`, and `long double`.
If a proposal like P1467R4 ("Extended floating-point types and standard names") is accepted,
it will grow to include implementation-specific types,
such as short or extended-precision floats.
This "future-proofs" our proposal in some sense,
though implementers will need to take care to avoid approximations
if the element type lacks the needed precision.

### Reordering sums and creating temporaries

Even textbook descriptions of linear algebra algorithms
presume the freedom to reorder sums and create temporary values.
Optimizations for memory locality and parallelism depend on this.
This freedom imposes requirements on algorithms' matrix and vector element types.

We could get this freedom either by
limiting our proposal to the Standard's current arithmetic types,
or by forbidding reordering and temporaries for types other than arithmetic types.
However, doing so would unnecessarily prevent straightforward optimizations
for small and fast types that act just like arithmetic types.
This includes so-called "short floats" such as bfloat16 or binary16,
extended-precision floating-point numbers, and fixed-point reals.
Some of these types may be implementation defined,
and others may be user-specified.
We intend to permit implementers to optimize for these types as well.
This motivates us to describe our algorithms' type requirements in a generic way.

#### Special case: Only one element type

We find it easier to think about type requirements
by starting with the assumption that
all element and scalar types in algorithms are the same.
One can then generalize to input element type(s) that might differ
from the output element type and/or scalar result type.

Optimizations for memory locality and parallelism
both create temporary values, and change the order of sums.
For example, reorganizing matrix data to reduce stride involves
making a temporary copy of a subset of the matrix,
and accumulating partial sums into the temporary copy.
Thus, both kinds of optimizations impose
a common set of requirements and assumptions on types.
Let `value_type` be the output `mdspan`'s `value_type`.
Implementations may:

1. create arbitrarily many objects of type `value_type`,
    value-initializing them or direct-initializing them
    with any existing object of that type;

2. perform sums in any order; or

3. replace any value with the sum of that value
    and a value-initialized `value_type` object.

Assumption (1) implies that the output value type is `semiregular`.
Contrast with **[algorithms.parallel.exec]**:
"Unless otherwise stated,
implementations may make arbitrary copies of elements of type `T`,
from sequences where `is_trivially_copy_constructible_v<T>`
and `is_trivially_destructible_v<T>` are true."
We omit the trivially constructible and destructible requirements here
and permit any `semiregular` type.
Linear algebra algorithms assume mathematical properties
that let us impose more specific requirements than general parallel algorithms.
Nevertheless, implementations may want to enable optimizations
that create significant temporary storage
only if the value type is trivially constructible,
trivially destructible, and not too large.

Regarding Assumption (2):
The freedom to compute sums in any order is not necessarily a type constraint.
Rather, it's a right that the algorithm claims,
regardless of whether the type's addition is associative or commutative.
For example, floating-point sums are not associative,
yet both parallelization and customary linear algebra optimizations
rely on reordering sums.
See the above "Value type constraints do not suffice to describe algorithm behavior" section
for a more detailed explanation.

Regarding Assumption (3),
we do not actually say that
value-initialization produces a two-sided additive identity.
What matters is what the algorithm's implementation may do,
not whether the type actually behaves in this way.

#### General case: Multiple input element types

An important feature of P1673 is the ability to compute
with mixed matrix or vector element types.
For instance, `add(y, scaled(alpha, x), z)` implements the operation z = y + alpha*x,
an elementwise scaled vector sum.
The element types of the vectors x, y, and z could be all different,
and could differ from the type of alpha.

##### Accumulate into output value type

Generic algorithms would use the output `mdspan`'s `value_type`
to accumulate partial sums, and for any temporary results.
This is the analog of `std::reduce`'s scalar result type `T`.
Implementations for floating-point types might accumulate into higher-precision temporaries,
or use other ways to increase accuracy when accumulating partial sums,
but the output `mdspan`'s `value_type` would still control accumulation behavior in general.

##### Proxy references or expression templates

1. Proxy references: The input and/or output `mdspan` might have an accessor
    with a `reference` type other than `element_type&`.
    For example, the output `mdspan` might have a value type `value_type`,
    but its `reference` type might be `atomic_ref<value_type>`.

2. Expression templates: The element types themselves might have arithmetic operations
    that defer the actual computation until the expression is assigned.
    These "expression template" types typically hold
    some kind of reference or pointer to their input arguments.

Neither proxy references nor expression template types are `semiregular`,
because they behave like references, not like values.
However, we can still require that their underlying value type be `semiregular`.
For instance, the possiblity of proxy references just means that
we need to use the output `mdspan`'s `value_type`
when constructing or value-initializing temporary values,
rather than trying to deduce the value type
from the type of an expression that indexes into the output `mdspan`.
Expression templates just mean that we need to use the output `mdspan`'s `value_type`
to construct or value-initialize temporaries,
rather than trying to deduce the temporaries' type
from the right-hand side of the expression.

The `z = y + alpha*x` example above shows that some of the algorithms we propose
have multiple terms in a sum on the right-hand side of the expression
that defines the algorithm.
If algorithms have permission to rearrange the order of sums,
then they need to be able to break up such expressions into separate terms,
even if some of those expressions are expression templates.

### "Textbook" algorithm description in semiring terms

As we explain in the
"Value type constraints do not suffice to describe algorithm behavior" section above,
we deliberately constrain matrix and vector element types
to require associative addition.
This means that we do not, for instance, define concepts like "ring" or "group."
We cannot even speak of a single set of values
that would permit defining things like a "ring" or "group."
This is because our algorithms must handle mixed value types,
expression templates, and proxy references.
However, it may still be helpful to use mathematical language
to explain what we mean by "a textbook description of the algorithm."

Most of the algorithms we propose only depend on addition and multiplication.
We describe these algorithms in terms of one or more mathematical expressions
on elements of a *semiring* with possibly noncommutative multiplication.
The only difference between a semiring and a ring
is that a semiring does not require all elements to have an additive inverse.
That is, addition is allowed, but not subtraction.
Implementers may apply any mathematical transformation to the expressions
that would give the same result for any semiring.

#### Why a semiring?

We use a semiring because

1. we generally want to reorder terms in sums,
    but we do not want to order terms in products; and

2. we do not want to assume that subtraction works.

The first is because linear algebra computations are useful
for matrix or vector element types with noncommutative multiplication,
such as quaternions or matrices.
The second is because algebra operations might be useful for signed integers,
where a formulation using subtraction risks unexpected undefined behavior.

#### Semirings and testing

It's important that implementers be able to test our proposed algorithms
for custom element types, not just the built-in arithmetic types.
We don't want to require hypothetical "exact real arithmetic" types
that take particular expertise to implement.
Instead, we propose testing with simple classes built out of unsigned integers.
This section is not part of our Standard Library proposal,
but we include it to give guidance to implementers
and to show that it's feasible to test our proposal.

#### Commutative multiplication

C++ unsigned integers implement commutative rings.
(Rings always have commutative addition;
a "commutative ring" has commutative multiplication as well.)
We may transform (say) `uint32_t` into a commutative semiring
by wrapping it in a class that does not provide unary or binary `operator-`.
Adding a "tag" template parameter to this class
would let implementers build tests for mixed element types.

#### Noncommutative multiplication

The semiring of 2x2 matrices with element type a commutative semiring
is itself a semiring,
but with noncommutative multiplication.
This is a good way to build a noncommutative semiring for testing.

### Summary

* Constraining the matrix and vector element types and scalar types in our functions
    gives implementers the freedom to make QoI enhancements
    without risking correctness.

* We think describing algorithms' behavior and implementation freedom
    is more useful than mathematical concepts like "ring."
    For example, we permit implementations to reorder sums,
    but this does not mean that they assume sums are associative.
    This is why we do not define a hierarchy of number concepts.

* We categorize different ways that implementers might like to change algorithms,
    list categories we exclude and categories we permit,
    and use the permitted categories to derive constraints
    on the types of matrix and vector elements and scalar results.

* We explain how a semiring is a good way to talk about implementation freedom,
    even though we do not think it is a good way to constrain types.
    We then use the semiring description to explain how implementers
    can test generic algorithms.

## Support for user-defined complex number types

### `conj` does not have the desired interface

Based on precedence from the BLAS and LAPACK,
generic linear algebra code that works for both complex and real numbers
uses the "conjugate transpose" for both cases,
and intends conjugation to be the identity for real numbers.
P1673 users may thus want to apply `conjugate_transposed`
to matrices of arbitrary value types.

The Standard currently offers `conj`
as the way to compute the conjugate of a number.
However, there are two issues with `conj`.

1. For arguments of arithmetic type, `conj` returns `complex`.
    The resulting value type change is mathematically unexpected,
    and it can hinder use of an optimized BLAS.

2. P1673 users have good reasons to define their own complex number types,
    but users cannot overload `conj` for these types.

### Why users define their own complex number types

1. `complex<R>` only permits `R` = `float`, `double`, and `long double`.

2. `complex<R>` only has `sizeof(R)` alignment, not `2 * sizeof(R)`.

3. Some C++ extensions cannot use `complex<R>`,
    because they require annotations on a type's member functions.

Users define their own complex number types for three reasons.
First, the C++ Standard currently supports `complex<R>`
only for `R` = `float`, `double`, and `long double`.
This prevents use of other types, including

* signed integers (the resulting complex numbers
    represent the *Gaussian integers*);

* "short" low-precision floating-point or fixed-point number types
    that are critical for performance of machine learning applications;

* extended-precision floating-point types like binary128
    that can improve the accuracy of floating-point sums,
    reduce parallel nondeterminism,
    and make sums less dependent on evaluation order; and

* custom number types such as "bigfloats"
    (custom arbitrary-precision floating-point types).

Second, the Standard explicitly specifies
that `complex<R>` has the same alignment as `R[2]`.
That is, it is aligned to `sizeof(R)`.
Some systems would give better parallel or vectorized performance
if complex numbers were aligned to `2 * sizeof(R)`.
Some C++ extensions define their own complex number types
partly for this reason.
Software libraries that use these custom complex number types
tempt users to alias between `complex<R>` and these custom types,
which would have the same bit representation except for alignment.
This has led to crashes or worse in software projects
that the authors have worked on.
Third, some C++ extensions cannot use `complex`,
because they require types' member functions to have special annotations,
in order to compile code to make use of accelerator hardware.

These issues have led several software libraries and C++ extensions
to define their own complex number types.
These include CUDA, Kokkos, and Thrust.
The SYCL standard is contemplating adding a custom complex number type.
One of the authors wrote `Kokkos::complex` circa 2014
to make it possible to build and run Trilinos' linear solvers
with complex numbers on NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs).

### Why users want to "conjugate" matrices of real numbers

It's possible to describe many linear algebra algorithms
in a way that works for both complex and real numbers,
by treating conjugation as the identity for real numbers.
This makes the "conjugate transpose" just the transpose
for a matrix of real numbers.
Matlab takes this approach, by defining the single quote operator
to take the conjugate transpose if its argument is complex,
and the transpose if its argument is real.
The Fortran BLAS also supports this,
by letting users specify the `'Conjugate Transpose'`
(`TRANSA='C'`) even for real routines like `DGEMM`
(double-precision general matrix-matrix multiply).
Krylov subspace methods in Trilinos' Anasazi and Belos packages
also follow a Matlab-like generic approach.

Even though we think it should be possible to write
"generic" (real or complex) linear algebra code using `conjugate_transposed`,
we still need to distinguish between symmetric and Hermitian matrix algorithms.
This is because symmetric does *not* mean the same thing as Hermitian
for matrices of complex numbers.
For example, a matrix whose off-diagonal elements are all `3 + 4i` is symmetric,
but not Hermitian.  Complex symmetric matrices are useful in practice,
for example when modeling damped vibrations (Craven 1969).

### Effects of `conj`'s real-to-complex change

The fact that `conj` for arithmetic-type arguments returns `complex`
may complicate or prevent implementers
from using an existing optimized BLAS library.
If the user calls `matrix_product` with matrices all of value type `double`,
use of the (mathematically harmless) `conjugate_transposed` function
would make one matrix have value type `complex<double>`.
Implementations could undo this value type change
for known layouts and accessors,
but would need to revert to generic code otherwise.

For example, suppose that a custom real value type `MyReal`
has arithmetic operators defined to permit
all needed mixed-type expressions with `double`,
where `double` times `MyReal` and `MyReal` times `double`
both "promote" to `MyReal`.
Users may then call `matrix_product(A, B, C)`
with `A` having value type `double`,
`B` having value type `MyReal`,
and `C` having a value type `MyReal`.
However, `matrix_product(conjugate_transposed(A), B, C)`
would not compile,
due to `complex<decltype(declval<double>() * declval<MyReal>())>`
not being well formed.

### LEWG feedback on R8 solution

In R8 of this paper,
we proposed an exposition-only function _`conj-if-needed`_.
For arithmetic types, it would be the identity function.
This would fix Issue (1).
For all other types, it would call `conj`
through argument-dependent lookup (ADL),
just like how `iter_swap` calls `swap`.
This would fix Issue (2).
However, it would force users who define custom _real_ number types
to define a trivial `conj` (in their own namespace) for their type.
The alternative would be to make _`conj-if-needed`_ the identity
if it could not find `conj` via ADL lookup.
However, that would cause silently incorrect results
for users who define a custom complex number type,
but forget or misspell `conj`.

When reviewing R8, LEWG expressed a preference for a different solution.

1. Temporarily change P1673 to permit
    use of `conjugated` and `conjugate_transposed`
    only for value types that are either `complex` or arithmetic types.
    Add a Note that reminds readers to look out for Steps (2) and (3) below.

2. Write a separate paper which introduces
    a user-visible customization point,
    provisionally named `conjugate`.
    The paper could use any of various proposed
    library-only customization point mechanisms,
    such as the customization point objects used by ranges
    or `tag_invoke`
    (see <a href="https://wg21.link/p1895r0">P1895R0</a>,
    with the expectation that LEWG and perhaps also EWG
    (see e.g., <a href="https://wg21.link/P2547">P2547</a>)
    may express a preference for a different mechanism.

3. If LEWG accepts the `conjugate` customization point,
    then change P1673 again to use `conjugate`
    (thus replacing R8's _`conj-if-needed`_).
    This would thus reintroduce support for custom complex numbers.

### SG6's response to LEWG's R8 feedback

SG6 small group (there was no quorum) reviewed P1673 on 2022/06/09,
after LEWG's R8 review on 2022/05/24.
SG6 small group expressed the following:

* Being able to write `conjugated(A)` or `conjugate_transposed(A)`
    for a matrix or vector `A` of user-defined types
    is reasonably integral to the proposal.
    We generically oppose deferring it based on the hope
    that we'll be able to specify it in a nicer way in the future,
    with some new customization point syntax.

* A simple, teachable rule: Do ADL-ONLY lookup
    (preventing finding `std::conj` for primitive types)
    for `conj` (as with ranges); if you find something you use it,
    and if you don't, you do nothing (conjugation is the identity).
    ("Primitives aren't that special.")
    Benefit is that custom real types work out of the box.

* The alternative: specify that if users choose to use
    `conjugated` or `conjugate_transposed` with a user-defined type,
    then they MUST supply the `conj` ADL-findable thing, else ill-formed.
    This is a safety mechanism that may not have been considered previously by LEWG.
    (Make primitives special, to regain safety.
    The cost is that custom real types need to have a `conj` ADL-findable,
    if users use `conjugated` or `conjugate_transposed`.)

### Current solution

We have adopted SG6 small group's recommendation,
with a slight wording modification to make it obvious
that the conjugate of an arithmetic type
returns the same type as its input.

We propose an exposition-only function object _`conj-if-needed`_.
For arithmetic types, it would behave as the identity function.
If it can call `conj` through ADL-only (unqualified) lookup,
it does so.  Otherwise, it again would behave as the identity function.

This approach has the following advantages.

1. Most custom number types, noncomplex or complex,
    will work "out of the box."
    Custom complex number types would likely
    already have an ADL-findable `conj` defined,
    for interface compatibility with `std::complex`.

2. Conjugation will preserve the type of its argument.

3. It uses existing C++ idioms and interfaces for complex numbers.

4. It does not depend on a future customization point syntax
    or library convention.

## Support for division with noncommutative multiplication

An important feature of this proposal is its support for value types
that have noncommutative multiplication.
Examples include
square matrices with a fixed number of rows and columns,
and quaternions and their generalizations.
Most of the algorithms in this proposal
only add or multiply arbitrary value types,
so preserving the order of multiplication arguments is straightforward.
The various triangular solve algorithms are an exception,
because they need to perform divisions as well.

If multiplication commutes and if a type has division,
then the division x ÷ y is just x times (the multiplicative inverse of y),
assuming that the multiplicative inverse of y exists.
However, if multiplication does not commute,
"x times (the multiplicative inverse of y)"
need not equal
"(the multiplicative inverse of y) times x."
The C++ binary `operator/` does not give callers
a way to distinguish between these two cases.

This suggests four ways to express "ordered division."

1. Explicitly divide one by the quotient:
    `x * (1/y)`, or `(1/y) * x`

2. Like (2), but instead of using literal `1`,
    get "one" as a `value_type` input to the algorithm:
    `x * (one/y)`, or `(one/y) * x`

3. `inverse` as a unary callable input to the algorithm:
    `x * inverse(y)`, or `inverse(y) * x`

4. `divide` as a binary callable input to the algorithm:
    `divide(x, y)`, or `divide(y, x)`

Both SG6 small group (in its review of this proposal on 2022/06/09)
and the authors prefer Way (4), the `divide` binary callable input.
The binary callable would be optional,
and ordinary binary `operator/` would be used as the default.
This would imitate existing Standard Library algorithms like `reduce`,
with its optional `BinaryOp` that defaults to addition.
For mixed-precision computation,
users would need to avoid `std::divides`,
as its two parameters and its return type all have the same types.
However, the obvious
`[] (const auto& x, const auto& y) { return x / y; }`
would work just fine.
Way (4) also preserves the original rounding behavior
for types with commutative multiplication.

The main disadvantage of the other approaches
is that they would change rounding behavior for floating-point types.
They also require two operations --
computing an inverse, and multiplication --
rather than one.
"Ordered division" may actually be the operation users want,
and the "inverse" might be just a byproduct.
This is the case for square matrices,
where users often "compute an inverse"
only because they want to solve a linear system.
Each of the other approaches has its own other disadvantages.

* Way (1) would assume that an overloaded `operator/(int, value_type)` exists,
    and that the literal `1` behaves like a multiplicative identity.
    In practice, not all custom number types may have defined
    mixed arithmetic with `int`.

* Way (2) would complicate the interface.
    Users might make the mistake of passing in literal `1` (of type `int`)
    or `1.0` (of type `double`) as the value of one,
    thus leading to Way (1)'s issues.

* Way (3) would again complicate the interface.
    Users would be tempted to use `[](const auto& y) { return 1 / y; }`
    as the inverse function, thus leading back to Way (1)'s issues.

# Future work

Summary:

1. Consider generalizing function parameters to take any type
    that implements a customization point
    for getting an `mdspan` viewing its elements.
    This includes `mdarray` (see P1684).

2. Add batched linear algebra overloads.

## Generalize function parameters

Our functions differ from the C++ Standard algorithms, in that they
take a concrete type `mdspan` with template parameters, rather
than any type that satisfies a concept.  We think that the template
parameters of `mdspan` fully describe the multidimensional
equivalent of a multipass iterator, and that "conceptification" of
multidimensional arrays would unnecessarily delay this proposal.

In a future proposal, we may consider generalizing our function's template
parameters, to permit any type besides `mdspan` that implements
the `get_mdspan` customization point, as long as the return value of
`get_mdspan` satisfies the current requirements.  `get_mdspan` would
return an `mdspan` that views its argument's data.

The `mdarray` class, proposed in <a href="https://wg21.link/p1684">P1684</a>, is the
container analog of `mdspan`.  It is a new kind of container,
with the same copy behavior as containers like `vector`.
It will be possible to get an `mdspan` that views an `mdarray`.
Previous versions of this proposal included function overloads that
took `mdarray` directly.  The goals were user convenience, and
to avoid any potential overhead of conversion to `mdspan`,
especially for very small matrices and vectors.  In a future revision
of P1684, `mdarray` will implement a customization point `view`
(final name yet to be decided),
that returns an `mdspan` viewing the elements of the `mdarray`.
This would let users use `mdarray` directly in our functions.
This customization point approach would also simplify using our functions
with other matrix and vector types, such as those proposed by P1385.
Implementations may optionally add direct overloads of our functions
for `mdarray` or other types.
This would address any concerns about overhead
of converting from `mdarray` to `mdspan`.

## Batched linear algebra

We plan to write a separate proposal that will add "batched" versions
of linear algebra functions to this proposal.  "Batched" linear
algebra functions solve many independent problems all at once, in a
single function call.  For discussion, see Section 6.2 of our
background paper <a href="https://wg21.link/p1417r0">P1417R0</a>.
Batched interfaces have the following advantages:

* They expose more parallelism and vectorization opportunities for
    many small linear algebra operations.

* They are useful for many different fields, including machine
    learning.

* Hardware vendors currently offer both hardware features and
    optimized software libraries to support batched linear algebra.

* There is an ongoing
    <a href="http://icl.utk.edu/bblas/">interface standardization effort</a>,
    in which we participate.

The `mdspan` data structure makes it easy to represent a batch
of linear algebra objects, and to optimize their data layout.

With few exceptions, the extension of this proposal to support batched
operations will not require new functions or interface changes.  Only
the requirements on functions will change.  Output arguments can have
an additional rank; if so, then the leftmost extent will refer to the
batch dimension.  Input arguments may also have an additional rank to
match; if they do not, the function will use ("broadcast") the same
input argument for all the output arguments in the batch.

# Data structures and utilities borrowed from other proposals

## `mdspan`

This proposal depends on P0009 and follow-on papers
that were voted into the current C++ Standard draft.
P0009's main class is `mdspan`, which is a "view"
(in the sense of `span`) of a multidimensional array.  The rank
(number of dimensions) is fixed at compile time.  Users may specify
some dimensions at run time and others at compile time; the type of
the `mdspan` expresses this.  `mdspan` also has two
customization points:

* `Layout` expresses the array's memory layout: e.g., row-major (C++
    style), column-major (Fortran style), or strided.  We use a custom
    `Layout` later in this paper to implement a "transpose view" of an
    existing `mdspan`.

* `Accessor` defines the storage handle (`data_handle_type`) stored in
    the `mdspan`, as well as the reference type returned by its access
    operator.  This is an extension point for modifying how access
    happens, for example by using `atomic_ref` to get atomic access to
    every element.  We use custom `Accessor`s later in this paper to
    implement "scaled views" and "conjugated views" of an existing
    `mdspan`.

## New `mdspan` layouts in this proposal

Our proposal uses the layout mapping policy of `mdspan` in order
to represent different matrix and vector data layouts.
The current C++ Standard draft includes three layouts:
`layout_left`, `layout_right`, and `layout_stride`.
<a href="https://wg21.link/p2642r2">P2642R2</a>
includes `layout_left_padded` and `layout_right_padded`.
These two layouts represent exactly the data layout assumed by
the General (GE) matrix type in the BLAS' C and Fortran bindings.
They have has two advantages:

1. Unlike `layout_left` and `layout_right`, any "submatrix" (subspan
    of consecutive rows and consecutive columns) of a matrix with
    `layout_left_padded` resp. `layout_right_padded` layout 
    also has `layout_left_padded` resp. `layout_right_padded` layout.

2. Unlike `layout_stride`, the two layouts always have
    compile-time unit stride in one of the matrix's two extents.

BLAS functions call the possibly nonunit stride of the matrix the
"leading dimension" of that matrix.  For example, a BLAS function
argument corresponding to the leading dimension of the matrix `A` is
called `LDA`, for "leading dimension of the matrix A."

This proposal introduces a new layout, `layout_blas_packed`.
This describes the layout used by the BLAS' Symmetric Packed (SP),
Hermitian Packed (HP), and Triangular Packed (TP) "types."
The `layout_blas_packed` class has a "tag" template parameter
that controls its properties; see below.

We do not include layouts for unpacked "types," such as Symmetric
(SY), Hermitian (HE), and Triangular (TR).
Our paper <a href="https://wg21.link/p1674">P1674</a>.
explains our reasoning.
In summary: Their actual layout -- the arrangement of
matrix elements in memory -- is the same as General.  The only
differences are constraints on what entries of the matrix algorithms
may access, and assumptions about the matrix's mathematical
properties.  Trying to express those constraints or assumptions as
"layouts" or "accessors" violates the spirit (and sometimes the law)
of `mdspan`.  We address these different matrix types with
different function names.

The packed matrix "types" do describe actual arrangements of matrix
elements in memory that are not the same as in General.  This is why
we provide `layout_blas_packed`.  Note that `layout_blas_packed` is
the first addition to the existing layouts that is neither always
unique, nor always strided.

Algorithms cannot be written generically if they permit output
arguments with nonunique layouts.  Nonunique output arguments require
specialization of the algorithm to the layout, since there's no way to
know generically at compile time what indices map to the same matrix
element.  Thus, we will impose the following rule: Any `mdspan`
output argument to our functions must always have unique layout
(`is_always_unique()` is `true`), unless otherwise specified.

Some of our functions explicitly require outputs with specific
nonunique layouts.  This includes low-rank updates to symmetric or
Hermitian matrices.

    the parameter(s)' `value_type` and `reference` type aliases;

* [1.2]{.pnum} the `Scalar` template parameter (if any) of any algorithm or class in **[linalg]**;

* [1.3]{.pnum} the `T` template parameter of any algorithm in **[linalg]** with a `T init` parameter; and

* [1.4]{.pnum} the template parameter of `sum_of_squares_result`.

[2]{.pnum} In this clause, we refer to these types as *linear algebra value types*.
These type requirements are parameterized by the algorithm or method using the type.
Each algorithm or method using the type has one or more associated mathematical expressions
that defines the algorithm's or method's behavior.
The requirements below will refer to those mathematical expression(s).
<i>[Note:</i>
This notion of parameterizing requirements on a mathematical expression
generalizes *GENERALIZED_SUM*.
<i>-- end note]</i>

[3]{.pnum} All of the following requirements presume that the algorithm's
asymptotic complexity requirements, if any, are satisfied.

* [3.1]{.pnum} Any linear algebra value type
    meets the requirements of `semiregular`.

* [3.2]{.pnum} The algorithm or method may perform read-only access
    on any input or output `mdspan` arbitrarily many times.

* [3.3]{.pnum} The algorithm or method may make arbitrary many objects
    of any linear algebra value type,
    value-initializing or direct-initializing them
    with any existing object of that type.

* [3.4]{.pnum} The algorithm or method may assign arbitrarily many times
    to any reference
    resulting from a valid output `mdspan` access.

* [3.5]{.pnum} If the algorithm's or method's mathematical expression
    uses division and possibly also
    addition, subtraction, and multiplication,
    then the algorithm or method
    evaluates the mathematical expression
    using a sequence of evaluations of
    `*`, `*=`, `/`, `/=`,
    `+`, `+=`, unary `-`, binary `-`, `-=`,
    and `=` operators
    that would produce the correct result
    when operating on elements of a field
    with noncommutative multiplication.
    (We interpret `a / b` as `a` times the multiplicative inverse of `b`.)
    Any addend,
    any subtrahend,
    any partial sum of addends in any order
    (treating any difference as a sum with the second term negated),
    any factor,
    any partial product of factors respecting their order in the mathematical expression,
    any numerator,
    any denominator,
    and any assignment in the mathematical expression
    shall be well formed.

* [3.6]{.pnum} Otherwise, if the algorithm's or method's
    mathematical expression
    uses subtraction and possibly also
    addition and multiplication,
    then the algorithm or method
    evaluates the mathematical expression
    using a sequence of evaluations of
    `*`, `*=`, `+`, `+=`,
    unary `-`, binary `-`, `-=`,
    and `=` operators
    that would produce the correct result
    when operating on elements of a ring
    with noncommutative multiplication.
    Any addend,
    any subtrahend,
    any partial sum of addends in any order
    (treating any difference as a sum with the second term negated),
    any factor,
    any partial product of factors respecting their order in the mathematical expression,
    and any assignment in the mathematical expression
    shall be well formed.

* [3.7]{.pnum} Otherwise, if the algorithm's or method's mathematical expression
    uses multiplication and possibly also addition,
    then the algorithm or method
    evaluates the mathematical expression
    using a sequence of evaluations of
    `*`, `*=`, `+`, `+=`, and `=` operators
    that would produce the correct result
    when operating on elements of a semiring
    with noncommutative multiplication.
    Any addend,
    any partial sum of addends in any order,
    any factor,
    any partial product of factors respecting their order in the mathematical expression,
    and any assignment in the mathematical expression
    shall be well formed.

* [3.8]{.pnum} Otherwise, if the algorithm's or method's mathematical expression
    uses addition,
    then the algorithm or method evaluates the mathematical expression
    using a sequence of evaluations of
    `+`, `+=`, and `=` operators
    that would produce the correct result
    when operating on elements of a commutative semigroup.
    Any addend,
    any partial sum of addends in any order,
    and any assignment in the mathematical expression
    shall be well formed.

* [3.9]{.pnum} If the algorithm's or method's mathematical expression includes any of the following:

    a. _`conj-if-needed`_`(z)` for some expression `z`,

    b. `abs(x)` for some expression `x`, or

    c. `sqrt(x)` for some expression `x`,

    but otherwise conforms to case (5), (6), (7), or (8),
    then the relevant case (5), (6), (7), or (8) applies.
    In addition, any of the above subexpressions that appear
    in the algorithm's or method's mathematical expression
    shall be well formed.

* [3.10]{.pnum} If the algorithm or method has an output `mdspan`,
    then all addends (or subtrahends, if applicable)
    in the algorithm's or method's mathematical expression
    are assignable and convertible to the output `mdspan`'s `value_type`.

* [3.11]{.pnum} The algorithm or method may reorder addends and partial sums
    in its mathematical expression arbitrarily.
    <i>[Note:</i>
    Factors in each product are not reordered;
    multiplication is not necessarily commutative.
    <i>-- end note]</i>

* [3.12]{.pnum} The algorithm or method may replace any value
    with the sum of that value
    and a value-initialized object
    of any input or output `mdspan`'s `value_type`.

* [3.13]{.pnum} If the algorithm or method has a `T init` parameter,
    then the algorithm or method may replace any value
    with the sum of that value
    and a value-initialized object of type `T`.

### Requirements for algorithms and methods on floating-point values [linalg.reqs.flpt]

[1]{.pnum} For all algorithms and classes in **[linalg]**, suppose that

* [1.1]{.pnum} all input and output `mdspan` have `value_type` a floating-point type,

* [1.2]{.pnum} any `Scalar` template argument has a floating-point type, and

* [1.3]{.pnum} any argument corresponding to the `T init` parameter has a floating-point type.

[2]{.pnum} Then, algorithms and classes' methods may do the following:

* [2.1]{.pnum} compute floating-point sums in any way that improves their accuracy for arbitrary input;

* [2.2]{.pnum} perform arithmetic operations other than those
    in the algorithm's or method's mathematical expression,
    in order to improve performance or accuracy; and

* [2.3]{.pnum} use approximations (that might not be exact even if computing with real numbers),
    instead of computations that would be exact
    if it were possible to compute without rounding error;

as long as

* [2.4]{.pnum} the algorithm or method satisfies the complexity requirements; and

* [2.5]{.pnum} the algorithm or method is *logarithmically stable*,
    in the sense of (Demmel 2007).
    <i>[Note:</i> Strassen's algorithm for matrix-matrix multiply
    is an example of a logarithmically stable algorithm. <i>-- end note]</i>

## Tag classes [linalg.tags]

### Storage order tags [linalg.tags.order]

```c++
struct column_major_t {
  explicit column_major_t() = default;
};
inline constexpr column_major_t column_major = { };

struct row_major_t {
  explicit row_major_t() = default;
};
inline constexpr row_major_t row_major = { };
```

[1]{.pnum} `column_major_t` indicates a column-major order,
and `row_major_t` indicates a row-major order.
The interpretation of each depends on
the specific layout that uses the tag.  See `layout_blas_packed` below.

### Triangle tags [linalg.tags.triangle]

[1]{.pnum} Some linear algebra algorithms distinguish between the "upper
triangle," "lower triangle," and "diagonal" of a matrix.

* [1.1]{.pnum} The *diagonal* is the set of all elements of `A` accessed by
    `A[i,i]` for 0 ≤ `i` < min(`A.extent(0)`, `A.extent(1)`).

* [1.2]{.pnum} The *upper triangle* of a matrix `A` is the set of all elements of
    `A` accessed by `A[i,j]` with `i` ≤ `j`.  It includes the diagonal.

* [1.3]{.pnum} The *lower triangle* of `A` is the set of all elements of `A`
    accessed by `A[i,j]` with `i` ≥ `j`.  It includes the diagonal.

```c++
struct upper_triangle_t {
  explicit upper_triangle_t() = default;
};
inline constexpr upper_triangle_t upper_triangle = { };

struct lower_triangle_t {
  explicit lower_triangle_t() = default;
};
inline constexpr lower_triangle_t lower_triangle = { };
```

[2]{.pnum} These tag classes specify whether algorithms
and other users of a matrix (represented as an `mdspan`) should
access the upper triangle (`upper_triangular_t`) or lower triangle
(`lower_triangular_t`) of the matrix.  This is also subject to the
restrictions of `implicit_unit_diagonal_t` if that tag is also
applied; see below.

<i>[Note:</i>
The `conjugate_transposed` and `transposed` functions in this section
return a view of an input `mdspan`
with its rightmost two indices effectively reversed.
Regardless, when we refer to the upper triangle of `B = transposed(A)`,
we still mean the elements of `B` accessed by `B[i,j]` with `i` ≤ `j`.
For all algorithms in this section that take a triangle tag parameter,
the triangle tag refers to the actual input matrix,
*after* any transformations like `transposed`.
This differs from the BLAS' `UPLO` argument,
which refers to the pre-transformed "original" matrix.
<i>-- end note]</i>

### Diagonal tags [linalg.tags.diagonal]

```c++
struct implicit_unit_diagonal_t {
  explicit implicit_unit_diagonal_t() = default;
};
inline constexpr implicit_unit_diagonal_t
  implicit_unit_diagonal = { };

struct explicit_diagonal_t {
  explicit explicit_diagonal_t() = default;
};
inline constexpr explicit_diagonal_t explicit_diagonal = { };
```

[1]{.pnum} These tag classes specify whether algorithms
should access the matrix's diagonal entries, and if not,
then how algorithms should interpret
the matrix's implicitly represented diagonal values.

[2]{.pnum} The `implicit_unit_diagonal_t` tag indicates two things:

  * [2.1]{.pnum} the algorithm will never access the `i,i` element
      of the matrix for any `i`; and

  * [2.2]{.pnum} the algorithm will interpret the matrix
      as if it has a "unit diagonal,"
      a diagonal each of whose elements behaves
      as a two-sided multiplicative identity
      (even if the matrix's value type does not have
      a two-sided multiplicative identity).

[3]{.pnum} The tag `explicit_diagonal_t` indicates that algorithms
may access the matrix's diagonal entries directly.

## Layouts for packed matrix types [linalg.layouts]

### `layout_blas_packed` [linalg.layouts.packed]

[1]{.pnum} `layout_blas_packed` is an `mdspan` layout mapping policy that
represents a square matrix that stores only the entries in one
triangle, in a packed contiguous format.  Its `Triangle` template
parameter determines whether an `mdspan` with this layout stores
the upper or lower triangle of the matrix.  Its `StorageOrder`
template parameter determines whether the layout packs the matrix's
elements in column-major or row-major order.

[2]{.pnum} A `StorageOrder` of `column_major_t` indicates column-major ordering.
This packs matrix elements starting with the leftmost (least column
index) column, and proceeding column by column, from the top entry
(least row index).

[3]{.pnum} A `StorageOrder` of `row_major_t` indicates row-major ordering.  This
packs matrix elements starting with the topmost (least row index) row,
and proceeding row by row, from the leftmost (least column index)
entry.

<i>[Note:</i> `layout_blas_packed` describes the data layout used by
the BLAS' Symmetric Packed (SP), Hermitian Packed (HP), and Triangular Packed
(TP) matrix types. <i>-- end note]</i>

[4]{.pnum} *Constraints:*

  * [4.1]{.pnum} `Triangle` is either `upper_triangle_t`
      or `lower_triangle_t`.

  * [4.2]{.pnum} `StorageOrder` is either `column_major_t`
      or `row_major_t`.

  * [4.3]{.pnum} `Extents` is a specialization of `extents`.

  * [4.4]{.pnum} `Extents::rank()` equals 2.

```c++
constexpr mapping(const extents_type& e) noexcept;
```

[5]{.pnum} *Preconditions:*

  * [5.1]{.pnum} The size of the multidimensional index space `e`
      is representable as a value of type `index_type`
      (**[basic.fundamental]**), and

_`the-extents`_ with `e`.

```c++
template<class OtherExtents>

    constexpr mapping(const mapping<OtherExtents>& other) noexcept;
```

[7]{.pnum} *Constraints:* `is_constructible_v<extents_type, OtherExtents>` is `true`.

[8]{.pnum} *Preconditions:* `other.required_span_size()` is representable as a value
    of type `index_type` (**[basic.fundamental]**).

[9]{.pnum} *Effects:* Direct-non-list-initializes _`the-extents`_ with `other.extents()`.

```c++
constexpr index_type required_span_size() const noexcept;

[10]{.pnum} *Returns:* `extent(0)` * (`extent(0)` + 1)/2.
<i>[Note:</i> For example, a 5 x 5 packed matrix
only stores 15 matrix elements. <i>-- end note]</i>

```c++
template<class ... Indices>
  constexpr index_type operator() (Indices... k) const noexcept;
```

[11]{.pnum} *Constraints*:

  * [11.1]{.pnum} `sizeof...(Indices)` equals `extents_type::rank()`,

  * [11.2]{.pnum} `(is_convertible_v<Indices, index_Type> && ...)` is `true`, and

  * [11.3]{.pnum} `(is_nothrow_constructible_v<index_type, Indices>)` is `true`.

[12]{.pnum} *Preconditions:* `extents_type::`_`index-cast`_`(k)` is
    a multidimensional index in _`the-extents`_ (**[mdspan.overview]**).

    let `i` be the zeroth element of `k`,
    and let `j` be the first element of `k`.  Then:

    * [13.1.1]{.pnum} if `Triangle` is `upper_triangle_t`,
        then `i` + `j` * (`j` + 1)/2 if `i` ≤ `j`,
        else `j` + `i` * (`i` + 1)/2;

    * [13.1.2]{.pnum} else, if `Triangle` is `lower_triangle_t`,
        then `i` + `N` * `j` - `j` * (`j` + 1)/2 if `i` ≥ `j`,
        else `j` + `N` * `i` - `i` * (`i` + 1)/2;

  * [13.2]{.pnum} else, if `StorageOrder` is `row_major_t` and

        then `j` + `i` * (`i` + 1)/2 if `i` ≥ `j`,
        else `i` + `j` * (`j` + 1)/2.

<i>[Note:</i> An `mdspan` layout mapping must permit access
for all multidimensional indices in the cross product of the extents,
so the above definition cannot exclude indices outside the matrix's triangle.
Instead, it interprets such indices
as if the matrix were symmetric. <i>-- end note]</i>

```c++
template<class OtherExtents>
  friend constexpr bool
    operator==(const mapping&, const mapping<OtherExtents>&) noexcept;
```

[14]{.pnum} *Constraints:* `OtherExtents::rank()` equals `rank()`.

[15]{.pnum} *Returns:* `true` if and only if
    for 0 ≤ `r` < `rank()`,
    `m.extent(r)` equals `extent(r)`.

```c++
constexpr index_type stride(rank_type) const noexcept;
```

[16]{.pnum} *Returns:* 1 if `extent(0)` is less than 2, else 0.

## Scaled in-place transformation [linalg.scaled]

[1]{.pnum} The `scaled` function takes a value `alpha` and an `mdspan` `x`,
and returns a new read-only `mdspan` with the same domain as `x`,
that represents the elementwise product of `alpha` with each element of `x`.

[*Example:*
```c++
// z = alpha * x + y
void z_equals_alpha_times_x_plus_y(
  mdspan<double, dextents<size_t, 1>> z,
  const double alpha,
  mdspan<double, dextents<size_t, 1>> x,
  mdspan<double, dextents<size_t, 1>> y)
{
  add(scaled(alpha, x), y, y);
}

// w = alpha * x + beta * y
void w_equals_alpha_times_x_plus_beta_times_y(
  mdspan<double, dextents<size_t, 1>> w,
  const double alpha,
  mdspan<double, dextents<size_t, 1>> x,
  const double beta,
  mdspan<double, dextents<size_t, 1>> y)
{
  add(scaled(alpha, x), scaled(beta, y), w);
}
```
--*end example*]

<i>[Note:</i> An implementation could dispatch to a function
in the BLAS library, by noticing that the first argument
has an `accessor_scaled` `Accessor` type.
It could use this information to extract the appropriate
run-time value(s) of the relevant BLAS function arguments
(e.g., `ALPHA` and/or `BETA`),
by calling `accessor_scaled::scaling_factor`. <i>-- end note]</i>

### Exposition-only function object _`conj-if-needed`_ [linalg.scaled.conj]

[1]{.pnum} The name _`conj-if-needed`_ denotes an exposition-only function object.
The expression _`conj-if-needed`_`(E)` for subexpression `E`
is expression-equivalent to:

  * [1.1]{.pnum} `E`, if `T` is an arithmetic type;

  * [1.2]{.pnum} else, `conj(E)`, if that expression is valid
      with overload resolution performed in a context
	    that includes the declaration
	    `template<class T> T conj(const T&) = delete;`
	    and does not include a declaration of
	    `linalg::`_`conj-if-needed`_;

  * [1.3]{.pnum} else, `E`.

<i>[Note:</i> The special case for arithmetic types
preserves the type of its argument, unlike `std::conj`.
The `conj(E)` case invokes `conj` via unqualified lookup.
The `E` case presumes that a type without a `conj` function is noncomplex,
so that the conjugate is the identity. <i>-- end note]</i>

### Exposition-only class templates _`proxy-reference-base`_ and _`proxy-reference`_ [linalg.scaled.base]

[1]{.pnum} The exposition-only class _`proxy-reference-base`_ is a tag
to identify whether a class is a specialization of either
_`scaled-scalar`_ **[linalg.scaled.accessor_scaled]** or
_`conjugated-scalar`_ **[linalg.scaled.accessor_conjugated]**.

[2]{.pnum} The exposition-only class template _`proxy-reference`_
is part of the implementation of 
_`scaled-scalar`_ **[linalg.scaled.accessor_scaled]** and
_`conjugated-scalar`_ **[linalg.scaled.accessor_conjugated]**.

### Exposition-only class template _`scaled-scalar`_

[1]{.pnum} The exposition-only class template _`scaled-scalar`_
represents a read-only value,
which is the product of a fixed value (the "scaling factor")
and the value of a reference to an element of a `mdspan`.
<i>[Note:</i> The value is read only to avoid confusion
with the definition of "assigning to a scaled scalar."  <i>-- end note]</i>
_`scaled-scalar`_ is part of the implementation of `accessor_scaled`
**[linalg.scaled.accessor_scaled]**.

```c++
template<class ScalingFactor, class ReferenceValue>
concept @_scalable_@ = // exposition only
requires {
  { declval<ScalingFactor>() * declval<ReferenceValue>() };
};

template<class ScalingFactor, class Reference, class ReferenceValue>
class @_scaled-scalar_@ : // exposition only
  public @_proxy-reference_@<Reference, ReferenceValue,
    @_scaled-scalar_@<ScalingFactor, Reference, ReferenceValue>>
{
private:
  ScalingFactor @_scaling-factor_@; // exposition only

  using @_my-type_@ = @_scaled-scalar_@<ScalingFactor, Reference, ReferenceValue>; // exposition only
  using @_base-type_@ = @_proxy-reference_@<Reference, ReferenceValue, @_my-type_@>; // exposition only
public:
  explicit @_scaled-scalar_@(const ScalingFactor& scaling_factor, const Reference& reference);

  using value_type = decltype(@_scaling-factor_@ * ReferenceValue(declval<Reference>()));
  value_type to_value(Reference reference) const;
};
```

<i>[Note:</i> The point of the `ReferenceValue` template parameter
is so that the input of `to_value` can be cast to a value immediately,
before any transformations are applied.
This ensures the original order of operations,
as if computing nonlazily.
It also makes fewer requirements of the reference type. <i>-- end note]</i>

[2]{.pnum} *Mandates:*

  * [2.1]{.pnum} _`scalable`_`<ScalingFactor, ReferenceValue>`, and

  * [2.2]{.pnum} `value_type` is a complete object type
      that is neither an abstract class type nor an array type.

[3]{.pnum} `ScalingFactor` models `semiregular`.

[4]{.pnum} `Reference` models `copy_constructible`.

```c++
explicit scaled_scalar(const ScalingFactor& scaling_factor, const Reference& reference);
```

[5]{.pnum} *Effects:*

  * [5.1]{.pnum} Direct non-list-initializes `static_cast<` _`base-type`_ `&>(*this)` with `reference`, and

  * [5.2]{.pnum} direct non-list-initializes _`scaling-factor`_ with `scaling_factor`.

```c++
value_type to_value(Reference reference) const;
```

[6]{.pnum} *Effects:* Equivalent to
`return` _`scaling-factor`_ ` * ReferenceValue(reference);`.

### Class template `accessor_scaled` [linalg.scaled.accessor_scaled]

[1]{.pnum} The class template `accessor_scaled` is an `mdspan` accessor
policy whose reference type represents the product of a fixed value
(the "scaling factor") and its nested `mdspan` accessor's
reference.  It is part of the implementation of `scaled`
**[linalg.scaled.scaled]**.

```c++
template<class ScalingFactor,
         class Accessor>
class accessor_scaled {
public:
  using reference = scaled_scalar<ScalingFactor,
    typename Accessor::reference,
    typename Accessor::element_type>;
  using element_type = add_const_t<typename reference::value_type>;
  using data_handle_type = Accessor::data_handle_type;
  using offset_policy = accessor_scaled<ScalingFactor, Accessor::offset_policy>;

  constexpr accessor_scaled(const ScalingFactor& s, const Accessor& a);

  constexpr reference access(data_handle_type p, size_t i) const noexcept;

  constexpr ScalingFactor scaling_factor() const;

  constexpr Accessor nested_accessor() const;

private:
  ScalingFactor @_scaling-factor_@; // exposition only
  Accessor @_nested-accessor_@; // exposition only
};
```

[2]{.pnum} *Mandates:*

  * [2.1]{.pnum} `is_copy_constructible_v<typename Accessor::reference>` is `true`.

  * [2.2]{.pnum} `ScalingFactor` models `semiregular`.

  * [2.3]{.pnum} `Accessor` meets the accessor policy requirements **[mdspan.accessor.reqmts]**.

```c++
constexpr accessor_scaled(const ScalingFactor& s, const Accessor& a);
```

[3]{.pnum} *Effects:*

  * [3.1]{.pnum} Direct non-list-initializes _`scaling-factor`_ with `s`, and

  * [3.2]{.pnum} direct non-list-initializes _`nested-accessor`_ with `a`.

```c++
constexpr reference access(data_handle_type p, size_t i) const noexcept;
```

[4]{.pnum} *Effects:* Equivalent to
`return reference(`_`scaling-factor`_`,` _`nested-accessor`_`.access(p, i));`.

```c++
constexpr offset_policy::data_handle_type
offset(data_handle_type p, size_t i) const noexcept;
```

[5]{.pnum} *Effects:* Equivalent to `return` _`nested-accessor`_`.offset(p, i);`.

```c++
constexpr ScalingFactor scaling_factor() const;
```

[6]{.pnum} *Effects:* Equivalent to `return` _`scaling-factor`_`;`.

```c++
constexpr Accessor nested_accessor() const;
```

[7]{.pnum} *Effects:* Equivalent to `return` _`nested-accessor`_`;`.

### `scaled` [linalg.scaled.scaled]

[1]{.pnum} The `scaled` function takes a scaling factor `alpha`
and an `mdspan` `x`,
and returns a new read-only `mdspan` with the same domain as `x`,
that represents the elementwise product of `alpha`
with each element of `x`.

<i>[Note:</i> Terms in this product
will not be reordered. <i>-- end note]</i>

```c++
template<class ScalingFactor,
         class ElementType,
         class Extents,
         class Layout,
         class Accessor>
constexpr auto scaled(
  ScalingFactor scaling_factor,
  const mdspan<ElementType, Extents, Layout, Accessor>& x);
```
[2]{.pnum} *Effects:* Equivalent to
`return mdspan{x.data(), x.mapping(), accessor_scaled{alpha, x.accessor()}};`.

<i>[Note:</i> The elements of the returned `mdspan` are read only.

Nested `scaled` expressions remain nested.
An expression such as `scaled(alpha, scaled(beta, x))`
would not be transformed into `scaled(alpha * beta, x)`.
This is because such transformations would change at least
the order of operations, and possibly also the result type.
For example, if `x` is a rank-1 `mdspan` whose `value_type` is `double`,
and if `sizeof(int)` is 4 and `double` is IEEE 754 binary64,
then `scaled(1 << 20, scaled(1 << 20, x))` does not overflow `int`,
but `scaled((1 << 20) * (1 << 20), x)`
would overflow `int`. <i>-- end note]</i>

[*Example:*
```c++
void test_scaled(mdspan<double, extents<int, 10>> x)
{
  auto x_scaled = scaled(5.0, x);
  for(int i = 0; i < x.extent(0); ++i) {
    assert(x_scaled[i] == 5.0 * x[i]);
  }
}
```
--*end example*]

## Conjugated in-place transformation [linalg.conj]

[1]{.pnum} The `conjugated` function takes an `mdspan` `x`,
and returns a new read-only `mdspan` `y` with the same domain as `x`,
whose elements are the complex conjugates
of the corresponding elements of `x`.

<i>[Note:</i> An implementation could dispatch to a function in the BLAS library,
by noticing that the `Accessor` type of an `mdspan` input
has type `accessor_conjugate`,
and that its nested `Accessor` type is compatible with the BLAS library.
If so, it could set the corresponding `TRANS*` BLAS function argument accordingly
and call the BLAS function. <i>-- end note]</i>

### Exposition-only class template _`conjugated-scalar`_

[1]{.pnum} The exposition-only class template _`conjugated-scalar`_
represents a read-only value, which is the complex conjugate
of the value of a reference to an element of an `mdspan`.
<i>[Note:</i> The value is read only to avoid confusion
with the definition of
"assigning to the conjugate of a scalar."  <i>-- end note]</i>
_`conjugated-scalar`_ is part of the implementation of `accessor_conjugate`
**[linalg.conj.accessor_conjugate]**.

```c++
template<class ReferenceValue>
concept @_conjugatable_@ = // exposition only
requires {
  { @_conj-if-needed_@(declval<ReferenceValue>()) } -> same_as<ReferenceValue>;
};

template<class Reference, @_conjugatable_@ ReferenceValue>

[2]{.pnum} `Reference` models `copy_constructible`.

```c++
using value_type = /* see below */;
```

[3]{.pnum} `value_type` names the type
`decltype(`_`conj-if-needed`_`(ReferenceValue(declval<Reference>())))`.

```c++
constexpr explicit @_conjugated-scalar_@(Reference reference);
```

[4]{.pnum} *Effects:* Initializes _`base-type`_ with `reference`.

```c++

```

[5]{.pnum} *Preconditions:* This function may be invoked arbitrarily many times.

### Class template `accessor_conjugate` [linalg.conj.accessor_conjugate]

[1]{.pnum} The class template `accessor_conjugate`
is an `mdspan` accessor policy whose reference type
represents the complex conjugate
of its nested `mdspan` accessor's reference.

[2]{.pnum} `Accessor` meets the `mdspan` accessor policy requirements
**[mdspan.accessor.reqmts]**.

## Transpose in-place transformation [linalg.transp]

### `transposed` [linalg.transp.transposed]

[1]{.pnum} The `transposed` function takes a rank-2 `mdspan`
representing a matrix, and returns a new read-only `mdspan`
representing the transpose of the input matrix.  The input matrix's
data are not modified, and the returned `mdspan` accesses the
input matrix's data in place.

```c++
template<class ElementType,
         class Extents,

```

[2]{.pnum} Let `ReturnExtents` name the type

  * [2.2]{.pnum} `ReturnLayout` is:

        for some `NestedLayout`, then `NestedLayout` <i>[Note:</i>
        this optimizes applying `transposed` twice
        to an `mdspan` with a custom layout,

    a.mapping().stride(0)),
  a.accessor());
```

  * [3.4]{.pnum} else, if `Layout` is `layout_stride`,
      then equivalent to
      <i>[Note:</i> this reverses the strides as well as
      the extents <i>-- end note]</i>
```c++
return R(a.data(),

## Conjugate transpose transform [linalg.conj_transp]

[1]{.pnum} The `conjugate_transposed` function
returns a conjugate transpose view of an object.
This combines the effects of `transposed` and `conjugated`.

```c++
template<class ElementType,
         class Extents,
         class Layout,
         class Accessor>
constexpr auto conjugate_transposed(
  mdspan<ElementType, Extents, Layout, Accessor> a);
```

[2]{.pnum} *Effects:* Equivalent to
`return conjugated(transposed(a));`.

[*Example:*
```c++
void test_conjugate_transposed(
  mdspan<complex<double>, extents<size_t, 3, 4>> a)
{
  const auto num_rows = a.extent(0);
  const auto num_cols = a.extent(1);

  auto a_ct = conjugate_transposed(a);
  assert(num_rows == a_ct.extent(1));
  assert(num_cols == a_ct.extent(0));
  assert(a.stride(0) == a_ct.stride(1));
  assert(a.stride(1) == a_ct.stride(0));

  for(size_t row = 0; row < num_rows; ++row) {
    for(size_t col = 0; col < num_rows; ++col) {
      assert(a[row, col] == conj(a_ct[col, row]));
    }
  }

  auto a_ct_ct = conjugate_transposed(a_ct);
  assert(num_rows == a_ct_ct.extent(0));
  assert(num_cols == a_ct_ct.extent(1));
  assert(a.stride(0) == a_ct_ct.stride(0));
  assert(a.stride(1) == a_ct_ct.stride(1));

  for(size_t row = 0; row < num_rows; ++row) {
    for(size_t col = 0; col < num_rows; ++col) {
      assert(a[row, col] == a_ct_ct[row, col]);
      assert(conj(a_ct[col, row]) == a_ct_ct[row, col]);
    }

## Exposition-only concepts and traits [linalg.concepts]

[1]{.pnum} The exposition-only concepts defined in this section
constrain the algorithms in *[linalg.algs]*.
The exposition-only trait(s) defined in this section

[2]{.pnum} If an algorithm in *[linalg.algs]* accesses the elements
of an _`in-vector`_, _`in-matrix`_, or _`in-object`_,
it will do so in read-only fashion.

<i>[Note:</i> The `element_type` of an
_`in-vector`_, _`in-matrix`_, or _`in-object`_ need not be `const`,
because an mdspan accessor with a nonconst `element_type`
need not necessarily be convertible to an accessor
with a const `element_type`. <i>-- end note]</i>

<i>[Note:</i> The exposition-only concept
_`possibly-packed-inout-matrix`_
constrains symmetric and Hermitian update algorithms.
These may write either to a unique-layout mdspan
or to a `layout_blas_packed` mdspan
(whose layout is nonunique). <i>-- end note]</i>

## Algorithms [linalg.algs]

### Requirements based on template parameter name [linalg.algs.reqs]

[1]{.pnum} Throughout this Clause, where the template parameters are not
constrained, the names of template parameters are used to express type
requirements.  In the requirements below, we use `*` in a typename to
denote a "wildcard," that matches zero characters, `_1`, `_2`, `_3`,
or other things as appropriate.

  * [1.1]{.pnum} Algorithms that have a template parameter
      named `ExecutionPolicy` are parallel algorithms
      **[algorithms.parallel.defns]**.

  * [1.2]{.pnum} `Real` is any type such that `complex<Real>` is specified.
      <i>[Note:</i> See **[complex.numbers.general]**. <i>-- end note]</i>

  * [1.3]{.pnum} `Triangle` is either `upper_triangle_t` or
      `lower_triangle_t`.

  * [1.4]{.pnum} `DiagonalStorage` is either `implicit_unit_diagonal_t` or
      `explicit_diagonal_t`.

  * [1.5]{.pnum} `BinaryDivideOp` template parameters
      are a binary function object (**[function.objects]**).

### BLAS 1 functions [linalg.algs.blas1]

<i>[Note:</i> The BLAS developed in three "levels": 1, 2, and 3.
BLAS 1 includes vector-vector operations,
BLAS 2 matrix-vector operations,
and BLAS 3 matrix-matrix operations.
The level coincides with the number of nested loops
in a naïve sequential implementation of the operation.
Increasing level also comes with increasing potential for data reuse.
The BLAS traditionally lists computing a Givens rotation
among the BLAS 1 operations,
even though it only operates on scalars. <i>-- end note]</i>

[1]{.pnum} *Complexity:*
All algorithms in this Clause with `mdspan` parameters
perform a count of `mdspan` array accesses and arithmetic operations
that is linear in the maximum product of extents of any `mdspan` parameter.

#### Givens rotations [linalg.algs.blas1.givens]

##### Compute Givens rotation [linalg.algs.blas1.givens.lartg]

```c++
template<class Real>
void givens_rotation_setup(const Real a,
                           const Real b,
                           Real& c,
                           Real& s,
                           Real& r);

template<class Real>
void givens_rotation_setup(const complex<Real>& a,
                           const complex<Real>& b,
                           Real& c,
                           complex<Real>& s,
                           complex<Real>& r);
```

[1]{.pnum} This function computes the plane (Givens) rotation
represented by the two values `c` and `s`
such that the 2x2 system of equations
<i>[Note:</i> use of monospaced text in this equation does not indicate C++ code <i>-- end note]</i>

```
[c        s]   [a]   [r]
[          ] * [ ] = [ ]
[-conj(s) c]   [b]   [0]
```

holds, where `c` is always a real scalar,
and `c*c + abs(s)*abs(s)` equals one.
That is, `c` and `s` represent a 2 x 2 matrix, that when multiplied by the
right by the input vector whose components are `a` and `b`, produces a
result vector whose first component `r` is the Euclidean norm of the
input vector, and whose second component as zero.

<i>[Note:</i>
This function corresponds to the LAPACK function `xLARTG`.
The BLAS variant `xROTG` takes four arguments -- `a`, `b`, `c`, and
`s`-- and overwrites the input `a` with `r`.  We have chosen
`xLARTG`'s interface because it separates input and output, and to
encourage following `xLARTG`'s more careful implementation.
<i>-- end note]</i>

<i>[Note:</i>
`givens_rotation_setup` has an overload for complex numbers,
because the output argument `c` (cosine) is a signed magnitude.
<i>-- end note]</i>

[2]{.pnum} *Effects:* Assigns to `c` and `s` the plane (Givens) rotation
corresponding to the input `a` and `b`.  Assigns to `r` the
Euclidean norm of the two-component vector formed by `a` and `b`.

[3]{.pnum} *Throws:* Nothing.

##### Apply a computed Givens rotation to vectors [linalg.algs.blas1.givens.rot]

```c++
template<@_inout-vector_@ InOutVec1,
         @_inout-vector_@ InOutVec2,
         class Real>
void givens_rotation_apply(
  InOutVec1 x,
  InOutVec2 y,
  const Real c,
  const Real s);

template<class ExecutionPolicy,
         @_inout-vector_@ InOutVec1,
         @_inout-vector_@ InOutVec2,
         class Real>
void givens_rotation_apply(
  ExecutionPolicy&& exec,
  InOutVec1 x,
  InOutVec2 y,
  const Real c,
  const Real s);

template<@_inout-vector_@ InOutVec1,
         @_inout-vector_@ InOutVec2,
         class Real>
void givens_rotation_apply(
  InOutVec1 x,
  InOutVec2 y,
  const Real c,
  const complex<Real> s);

template<class ExecutionPolicy,
         @_inout-vector_@ InOutVec1,
         @_inout-vector_@ InOutVec2,
         class Real>
void givens_rotation_apply(
  ExecutionPolicy&& exec,
  InOutVec1 x,
  InOutVec2 y,
  const Real c,
  const complex<Real> s);
```

<i>[Note:</i>
These functions correspond to the BLAS function `xROT`.  `c` and `s`
form a plane (Givens) rotation.  Users normally would compute `c` and
`s` using `givens_rotation_setup`, but they are not required to do
this.

For `i` in the domains of both `x` and `y`,
if $x_i$ is the value of `x[i]` on input
and $y_i$ is the value of `y[i]` on input,
then this algorithm computes
$x_i'$ such that $x_i' = c x_i + s y_i$ and
$y_i'$ such that $y_i' = c y_i - \bar{s} x_i$
(where $\bar{s}$ denotes the complex conjugate of $s$),
and assigns $x_i'$ to `x[i]` and $y_i'$ to `y[i]`.
<i>-- end note]</i>

[1]{.pnum} *Preconditions:* `x.extent(0)` equals `y.extent(0)`.

[2]{.pnum} *Mandates:* If neither `x.static_extent(0)`
nor `y.static_extent(0)` equals `dynamic_extent`,
then `x.static_extent(0)` equals `y.static_extent(0)`.

[3]{.pnum} *Effects:* Applies the plane (Givens) rotation
specified by `c` and `s` to the input vectors `x` and `y`,
as if the rotation were a 2 x 2 matrix and
the input vectors were successive rows of a matrix with two rows.

#### Swap matrix or vector elements [linalg.algs.blas1.swap]

```c++
template<@_inout-object_@ InOutObj1,
         @_inout-object_@ InOutObj2>
void swap_elements(InOutObj1 x,
                   InOutObj2 y);

template<class ExecutionPolicy,
         @_inout-object_@ InOutObj1,
         @_inout-object_@ InOutObj2>
void swap_elements(ExecutionPolicy&& exec,
                   InOutObj1 x,
                   InOutObj2 y);
```

<i>[Note:</i> These functions correspond to the BLAS function `xSWAP`.
<i>-- end note]</i>

[1]{.pnum} *Preconditions:* For all `r` in 0, 1, ..., `x.rank()` - 1,
`x.extent(r)` equals `y.extent(r)`.

[2]{.pnum} *Constraints:* `x.rank()` equals `y.rank()`.

[3]{.pnum} *Mandates:* For all `r` in 0, 1, ..., `x.rank()` - 1,
if neither `x.static_extent(r)` nor `y.static_extent(r)`
equals `dynamic_extent`,
then `x.static_extent(r)` equals `y.static_extent(r)`.

[4]{.pnum} *Effects:* Swap all corresponding elements of `x` and `y`.

#### Multiply the elements of an object in place by a scalar [linalg.algs.blas1.scal]

```c++
template<class Scalar,
         @_inout-object_@ InOutObj>
void scale(const Scalar alpha,
           InOutObj x);

template<class ExecutionPolicy,
         class Scalar,
         @_inout-object_@ InOutObj>
void scale(ExecutionPolicy&& exec,
           const Scalar alpha,
           InOutObj x);
```

<i>[Note:</i> These functions correspond to the BLAS function `xSCAL`.
<i>-- end note]</i>

[5]{.pnum} *Effects*: Overwrites $x$ with the result of
computing the elementwise multiplication $alpha x$.

#### Copy elements of one matrix or vector into another [linalg.algs.blas1.copy]

```c++
template<@_in-object_@ InObj,
         @_out-object_@ OutObj>
void copy(InObj x,
          OutObj y);

template<class ExecutionPolicy,

         @_out-object_@ OutObj>
void copy(ExecutionPolicy&& exec,
          InObj x,
          OutObj y);
```

<i>[Note:</i> These functions correspond to the BLAS function `xCOPY`.

<i>[Note:</i> Like `reduce`, `dot` applies binary `operator+` in an
unspecified order.  This may yield a nondeterministic result for
non-associative or non-commutative `operator+` such as floating-point
addition.  However, implementations may perform extra work to make the
result deterministic.  They may do so for all `dot` overloads, or just
for specific `ExecutionPolicy` types. <i>-- end note]</i>

[3]{.pnum} If `DiagonalStorage` is `explicit_diagonal_t`,
then for `i,j` in the domain of `X`,

  * `X[i,j] = divide(B[i,j] - s, A[j,j])`
      for overloads with a `divide` parameter, and

  * `X[i,j] = (B[i,j] - s) / A[j,j]` for all other overloads,

where `s` is the sum of `X[i,k] * A[k,j]`
for all `k` not equal to `j`
in the subset of the domain of `A` specified by `t`.

<i>[Note:</i> Since the triangular matrix is on the right,
the desired `divide` implementation
in the case of noncommutative multiplication
would be mathematically equivalent to
the product of the first argument, and
(the inverse of the second argument),
in that order. <i>-- end note]</i>

[4]{.pnum} If `DiagonalStorage` is `implicit_unit_diagonal_t`,

in the subset of the domain of `A` specified by `t`.

<i>[Note:</i> One can derive these mathematical expressions
from the mathematical expressions of the
`triangular_matrix_matrix_left_solve()` algorithm,
by swapping the order of indices of each matrix access
(representing the transpose), swapping `i` and `j`,
and swapping the order of product terms in the sum `s`.
This is because
`triangular_matrix_matrix_left_solve()` solves AX = B,
taking the transpose of both sides does not change the equation,
and the transpose of a product of two matrices
is the product of the reversed matrices
in transposed order. <i>-- end note]</i>

## Cholesky factorization

[1]{.pnum} This example shows how to compute
the Cholesky factorization of
a real symmetric positive definite matrix $A$
stored as an `mdspan` with a unique non-packed layout.
The algorithm imitates `DPOTRF2` in LAPACK 3.9.0.
If `Triangle` is `upper_triangle_t`,
then it computes the factorization $A = U^T U$ in place,
with U stored in the upper triangle of A on output.
Otherwise, it computes the factorization $A = L L^T$ in place,
with L stored in the lower triangle of A on output.
The function returns 0 if success,
else k+1 if row/column k has a zero
or NaN (not a number) diagonal entry.

returned `nullopt`, indicating no zero or NaN pivots.
