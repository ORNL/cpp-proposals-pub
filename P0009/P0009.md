# Revision History
## P0009r15: 2022-01 Mailing

#### Changes from R14
- `mdspan::rank[_dynamic]` returns `size_t`
- fix comparison operator for `layout_stride` to take strides into account.
- fix `layout_stride` mapping `required_span_size`
- Consistently use "`<`_expr_`>` is `true`" instead of "`<`*expr*`>` is true".
- In the layout mappings' `operator()` *Effects* clauses, use only `index_sequence`and fix syntax error in `stride(P())`.
- Replace various unary folds with binary to handle `extents<>`.
- Consistently use `Extents::rank()` in layout mapping wording.
- Typo in `mdspan::mapping_type`: `template mapping_type` should be `template mapping`.
- `mdspan`'s `array` constructor calls `Extents`'s `array` constructor.
- Clarify the value of `static_stride` for `submdspan`'s result.

- Significant editorial changes based on LWG small-group review

## P0009r14: 2021-11 Mailing

#### LEWG Review 11/01/2021
- ACTION: Maybe a default constructible accessor should imply default constructible spans.  Default constructible spans are important in many cases.
  - done
- ACTION: Make extents conditionally explicit when converting from dynamic to static extents.
  - done
- ACTION: Make layout and mdspan converting constructors conditionally explicit based upon the underlying types
  - done
- ACTION: constructing extents from std::array needs a deduction guide?
  - not done: you can't do this since you can't use alias and you can't return a parameter pack
- QUESTION: Extents parameter pack ctor needs to be explicit?  Deduction guide needs to be explicit?
  - we made that change
- QUESTION: submdspan constructor can take tuple<size_t, size_t> and get pair<size_t, size_t> for free (could add specific type for submdspan, so long as it can be converted from pair and tuple).
  - we changed submdspan to take things convertible to `tuple<size_t,size_t>`
- ACTION: needs feature test macro
  - done
- QUESTION: Can get rid of mdspan ctor takes pointer + array?  Can construct extent from array.  Disagreement on authors on this one.
  - not done: would remove ctad from array
- ACTION: Explore modifying the requirements on which extents need to be provided when constructing an mdspan or extents object.
  - done
  - Authors decided to enable construction from both dynamic extents only, and all extents (for both integer packs and arrays)
  - Why from dynamic extents only:
    - no redundant information
    - precondition free constructor
    - enables fully static extents mdspan construction from ptr only
  - Why from all extents:
    - no confusion what extent a given argument is associated with
    - enables easier writing of certain types of generic code e.g.:
      ```c++
      template<class mds1_t, class mds2_t>
      auto alloc_gemm_result(mds1_t mdspan1, mds2_t mdspan2) {
         using return_t = mdspan<double,
           Extents< mds1_t::extents_type::static_extent<0>,
                    mds2_t::extents_type::static_extent<1>>;
         double* ptr = new double[mdspan1.extent(0)*mdspan2.extent(1)];
         return return_t(ptr, mdspan1.extent(0),mdspan2.extent(1));
       }
       ```

#### Changes from R13

- changes to harmonize with `std::span`
  - made `extents` converting constructor conditionally explicit, for cases where dynamic extents are turned into static extents
  - made convertibility of `default_accessor` depend on convertibility of `element_type(*)[]` instead of `pointer` to prevent derived class to base class assignment
  - remove converting assignment operators throughout
- made layout mapping converting constructors conditionally explicit, depending on `extents` being not implicitly convertible
- made `mdspan` converting constructor conditionally explicit, for cases where any of the exposition only members or the template
parameters are only explicitly convertible
- Improve submdspan wording
  - the wording defines more clearly how the submdspan is constructed, not just through ensures
- made layout wording style consistent
- don't require default constructibility from accessors and mappings (still require it for pointer though)
- fixed layout_stride conversion construction
- made deduction guide from integers for extents/mdspan explicit
- tweaked constraints on mdspan to not include element type and the full extents 
  - left pointer, since mdspan converts those in its converting constructor
  - also left some specific constraints regarding extents to prevent custom layouts from
    changing rank or assigning different sized static extents
- add feature test macro
- accept `tuple` instead of `pair` for subslice arguments in `submdspan`.
- remove `mdspan::unique_size`
- fix `layout_stride` constructor to be flexible with integral types of strides array
- make `extents` and `mdspan` constructors accept either `rank_dynamic` or `rank` integer arguments (or an `array` of that size)
- remove mdspan trivially default constructible clause: it never is because we value initialize pointer inline
- remove *nonowning* word from mdspan description: there is not really a reason to have it. Would allow `shared_ptr` as `pointer`
- allow conversion for 1D `layout_left` to `layout_right` and vice versa
- allow implicit conversion for rank-0 `layout_left`, `layout_right`, and `layout_stride` to each other

## P0009r13: 2021-10 Mailing

LEWG reviewed P0009r12 together with P2299r3 on 2021-06-08.

<b>LEWG Poll</b> Approve the direction of P2299R3 and merge it into P0009.

Attendance: 25; Number of authors: 1 [presumably for P2299, as P0009 coauthors were also attending]; Author's Position: SF.

- Incorporated changes proposed by P2299r3
  - Added `dextents` alias
  - Removed `mdspan` alias and renamed `basic_mdspan` to `mdspan`
    (which is now a class type, not an alias).
    This undoes a change introduced in P0009r6.
    P2299r3 explains the rationale.
    Existing code using the `mdspan` alias will need to change
    by replacing the list of extents template arguments with a single `extents` type.
  - Added `mdspan` deduction guides
  - As needed for deduction guides, added `layout_type` alias
    to layout mapping requirements and to `layout_left`, `layout_right`, and `layout_stride`
- Adapted new LWG wording guidelines by replacing "Expects" with "Preconditions"
- Minor formatting corrections
- Added design discussion as requested by LEWG
- Remove unconditional `noexcept` from `mdspan`
- Fix layout `required_span_size` for rank-0 mdspan
- Fix `layout_stride::required_span_size` for mdspans with at least one extent being zero
- Use `operator[]` in `mdspan` for multidimensional array access,
  and add explanation to Discussion section
- Remove reference to `span` in the `mdspan` wording,
  since `mdspan` does not necessarily require a backing `span`
  (because `pointer` need not be `ElementType*`)
- added conversion constructor for strided and unique layouts to `layout_stride`
- added constructor for `mdspan` from `pointer` and `extents`
- added requirement for layout policy mapping to be nothrow move constructible and assignable
- added requirement for accessor policy to be nothrow move constructible and assignable
- added requirement for accessor policy pointer to be nothrow move constructible and assignable
- remove throws nothing clauses from mdspan and submdspan.

## P0009r12: post 2021-05 Mailing
- Fixed definition of `static_extent`
- Added converting constructor for `default_accessor` (when the pointers to
  elements are convertible) for things like `default_accessor<double>` to `default_accessor<const double>`
- Changed [mdspan.accessor.basic] to [mdspan.accessor.default], to correspond with the name change
  in P0009r11
- Minor formatting corrections

## P0009r11: 2021-05 Mailing

- Ask LEWG to poll on targeting P0009 for C++23
- Change all the sizes from `ptrdiff_t` to `size_t` and `index_type` to `size_type`,
  for consistency with `span` and the rest of the standard library`
- Renamed `IndexType` to `SizeType` or `SizeTypes` (depending if it is a single
  type or a parameter pack)
- Changed comparisons to hidden friends
- Explicitly mention which types are trivially copyable or empty.  This is important as
  a major intended use case for this is heterogeneous computing.
  A trivially copyable is heavily used as a proxy for types which can be copied between a host (such as a CPU)
  and a device (such as a GPU) or between two devices by just copying the bytes which make up the object
  representation of the type.
  If they are not trivially copyable, heterogeneous computing would not be able to use these types as vocabulary types.
- State the conditions that make `basic_mdspan` trivially default constructible
- In `layout_*` types, made `operator()` and `stride()` constexpr
- In `layout_stride`, made assignment operators and `required_span_size()` constexpr
  to match the other `layout_*` types
- Renamed `subspan` to `submdspan`, as this only applies to `mdspan`
- Made `submdspan()` constexpr
- Tweak the wording of `is_strided`
- Renamed `all_type` to `full_extent_t` and `all` to `full_extent`
- Renamed `accessor_basic` to `default_accessor`
- Removed accessor policy `decay(p)` member function as it was an artifact 
  from an earlier version of this proposal when `basic_mdspan` had a `span()`
  member function that returned a `std::span`
- Removed `span()` from [mdspan.basic.members] description as `.span()` was removed
  from an earlier version of this proposal

## P0009r10: Pre 2020-02-Prague Mailing

- Switched to  mpark/wg21 pandoc format
- Add general description of span and mdspan
- Removed `mdspan_subspan` expo only type; use `basic_mdspan<`*see below*`>` instead
- Fixed typos in accessor table
- Made editorial changes to wording based on San Diego feedback
- Updated operational semantics subsection heading based on new style guidelines


## P0009r9: Pre 2019-02-Kona Mailing

## P0009r8: Pre 2018-11-SanDiego Mailing

- Refinement based upon updated [prototype](https://github.com/ORNL/cpp-proposals-pub/blob/master/P0009/prototype) / reference implementation

## P0009r7: Post 2018-06-Rapperswil Mailing

- wording reworked based on guidance: [LWG review at 2018-06-Rapperswil](http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21rapperswil2018/LWGSatAM)
- usage of `span` requires reference to C++20 working draft
- namespace for library TS `std::experimental::fundamentals_v3`

# Description

## What we propose to add

This paper proposes adding to the C++ Standard Library
a multidimensional array view, `mdspan`,
along with classes, class templates, and constants
for describing and creating multidimensional array views.
It also proposes adding the `submdspan` function that "slices"
(returns an `mdspan` that views a subset of) an existing mdspan`.

The `mdspan` class template can represent arbitrary mixes
of compile-time or run-time extents.
Its element type can be any complete object type
that is neither an abstract class type nor an array type.
It has two customization opportunities for users:
the *layout mapping* and the *accessor*.
The layout mapping specifies the formula, and properties of the formula,
for mapping a multidimensional index to an element of the array.
The accessor governs how elements are read and written.

## Definitions

A *multidimensional array view* views a multidimensional array,
just as a `span` views a one-dimensional `array` or `vector`.

A *multidimensional array* of *rank* <math>R</math>
maps from a tuple of <math>R</math> indices to a single offset index.
Each of the <math>R</math> indices in the tuple
is in a bounded range whose inclusive lower bound is zero,
and whose nonnegative exclusive upper bound is that index's *extent*.
The array thus has <math>R</math> extents.
The offset index ranges over a subset of a bounded contiguous index range
whose lower bound is zero,
and whose upper bound is the product of the <math>R</math> extents.

More formally, a multidimensional array of rank <math>R</math>
maps from its *domain*, a multidimensional index space of rank <math>R</math>,
to its *codomain*, a set of objects accessible from a contiguous range of integer indices.
A *multidimensional index space* of rank <math>R</math>

A *multidimensional index*
is a element of a multidimensional index space.

## Why do we need multidimensional arrays?

Multidimensional arrays are fundamental concepts in many fields,
including graphics, mathematics, statistics, engineering, and the sciences.
Many programming languages thus come with multidimensional array data structures
either as a core language feature,
or as a tightly integrated standard library.
Example languages include
Ada, ANSI Common Lisp, APL, C#, Fortran, Julia, Matlab, Mathematica,
Pascal, Python (via NumPy), and Visual Basic.
The original version of the Fortran language for the IBM 704
featured arrays with one, two, or three extents (Backus 1956, pp. 10-11).

Multidimensional arrays have long been useful
for representing large amounts of data,
describing points in physical space,
or expressing approximations of functions.
They are a natural way to represent mathematical objects like matrices and tensors.
This makes multidimensional arrays a critical data structure for many computations
at the heart of modern machine learning.
In fact, one of the predominant machine learning frameworks
is called [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Why are existing C++ data structures not enough?

C++ currently has the following approaches
that could be used to represent multidimensional arrays:

1. "native" arrays where all the extents are compile-time constants,
  like `int[3][4][5]`;

2. pointer-of-pointers(-of-pointers...), like `int***`,
  set up as a data structure to view multidimensional data;

3. arrays-of-arrays(-of-arrays...) data structures,
  like `vector<vector<array<int, N>>>`; or

4. `gslice`, which selects a subset of indices of a `valarray`
  and can be used to impose a multidimensional array layout
  on the `valarray`, in a way analogous to `layout_stride`.

If a multidimensional array has any extents
that are not known at compile time, Approach (1) does not work.

Approach (2) does not suffice as a stand-alone data structure,
because a pointer-of-pointers does not carry along
the array's run-time extents.
Users thus end up building some subset of `mdspan`'s functionality
to represent a multidimensional array view.
Every run-time extent other than the rightmost
requires a separate memory allocation for an array of pointers.
A pointer-of-pointers also loses information
about any dimensions known at compile time.
Users cannot arbitrarily mix compile-time and run-time extents.

Approach (3) can mix `vector` and `array` to represent extents
known at run time resp. compile time.
However, any use of `vector` at any position other than the outermost
results in the data structure no longer having
a contiguous memory allocation (or a subset thereof) for the elements.
This makes the data structure incompatible with many libraries
that expect a subset of a contiguous allocation.
Also, every run-time extent other than the rightmost
requires a separate memory allocation for an array of arrays.
In addition, each element access requires reading
multiple memory locations ("pointer chasing").
Finally, the inlining depth for an element access
is proportional to the array's rank.

Approach (4) is meant for addressing many elements of a `valarray` all at once.
Even though `valarray` itself is a one-dimensional array,
one can use `gslice` to make the `valarray` represent multidimensional data.
Giving a `gslice` to `valarray::operator[]` returns something that references
a subset of elements of the original `valarray`.
However, the result (a `gslice_array` in the nonconst case,
some type that might be an expression template in the const case)
is not guaranteed to have an `operator[]`.
Thus, it's not a view, whereas our proposed `submdspan` function
always takes and returns a view.
In the const case, the result might even be a (deep) copy of the input.
Finally, `gslice` offers no efficient way to address a single element.
The `gslice` constructor takes strides and lengths as `valarray`s
and is meant for array-based computation.
Accessing a single element requires accessing
the memory of three `valarray`s.

## Mixing compile-time and run-time extents

The fundamental reason to allow expressing extents at compile time is performance.
Knowing an extent at compile time enables many compiler optimizations,
such as unrolling and precomputing of offsets.
These can significantly improve the generated code.
Not storing extents at run time
may help conserve registers and stack space.

In many fields, some extents are naturally known at compile time.
For many physics and engineering algorithms,
some extents are dictated by fundamental properties of the physical world
or the discretization scheme.
For example, the position of a particle in space
requires a rank-3 array, since physical space has three dimensions.
At the same time, other extents are only known at run time,
such as the number of particles in a simulation.
A natural data structure for storing a list of particles
would thus be a rank-2 array,
where the one run-time extent is the number of particles
and the one compile-time extent is three.
In graphics, some of the most fundamental objects are square matrices
with 2, 3, or 4 rows and columns.
The number of matrices with which one would like to compute
might only be known at run time.
This would make a rank-3 array with two compile-time extents
a natural data structure for the matrices.

## Why custom memory layouts?

Our `mdspan` class template permits custom layouts.
Our proposal comes with three memory layouts:

* `layout_right`: C or C++ style, row major,
  where the rightmost index gives stride-1 access to the underlying memory;

* `layout_left`: Fortran or Matlab style, column major,
  where the leftmost index gives stride-1 access to the underlying memory;

* `layout_stride`: a generalization of the two layouts above,
  which stores a separate stride (possibly not one) for each extent.

"Custom" layouts besides these could include space-filling curves or "tiled" layouts.

An important reason we allow different layouts is language interoperability.
For example, C++ and Fortran have different "native" layouts.
Python's NumPy arrays have a configurable layout,
to provide compatibility with both languages.

Control of the layout can also be used to write code
that performs well on different computer architectures
when only changing a template argument.
Consider the following implementation of a parallel dense matrix-vector product.



```c++
using layout = /* see-below */;

std::mdspan<double, std::extents<N, M>, layout> A = ...;
std::mdspan<double, std::extents<N>> y = ...;
std::mdspan<double, std::extents<M>> x = ...;

std::ranges::iota_view range{0, N};

std::for_each(std::execution::par_unseq, 
  std::ranges::begin(range), std::ranges::end(range),
  [=](int i) {
     double sum = 0.0;
     for(int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
       sum += A[i, j] * x[j];
     }
     y[i] = sum;
  });

```

On conventional CPU architectures,
this code performs well with `layout = layout_right`,
the native C++ row-major layout.
However, when offloading the `for_each` to NVIDIA GPUs
(which NVIDIA's `nvc++` compiler can do),
`layout = layout_left` (Fortran's column-major layout) performs much better,
since it enables coalesced data access on the matrix `A`.

However, it is not enough to have just C++ and Fortran memory mappings.
For instance, one way to compute tensor products is to decompose them
into many matrix-matrix multiplications.
The resulting decomposition may involve matrices with non-unit strides in both extents.
This means that they have neither a row-major nor a column-major layout.

More complex layouts can improve performance significantly for some algorithms.
For instance, tiling (a "matrix of small matrices" layout)
can improve data locality for many computations
relevant to linear algebra and the discretization of partial differential equations.
Tiled layouts can also improve vectorization.
For example, Intel's Math Kernel Library introduced the Vectorized Compact Routines.
These provide "batched" matrix operations that increase available parallelism
by operating on many matrices at once.
The Vectorized Compact Routines accept matrices in an "interleaved" layout
that optimizes vectorized memory access.

Another design goal for our custom layouts is to permit nonunique layouts.
A *nonunique* layout lets multiple index tuples refer to the same element.
This can save memory for data structures that have natural symmetry.
For example, if `A` is a symmetric matrix,
then `A[i,j]` and `A[j,i]` refer to the same element,
so the element can and should only be stored once.

## Why custom accessors?

Custom accessors can provide information to the compiler,
or permit the injection of special ways of doing data access.
Most hardware today has more ways to access data than simple reads and writes.
For example, some instructions affect caching behavior,
by making loads and/or stores nontemporal (not cached at some level)
or even noncoherent.
Other instructions implement atomic access.
This is why several of us proposed `atomic_ref`,
as the heart of an "atomic accessor" for `mdspan`.
C's `restrict` qualifier conveys whether an array is assumed
never to alias another array in some context.
The `volatile` keyword is yet another qualifier
which limits compiler optimizations around data access.
Custom `mdspan` accessors can apply `restrict`
(if the C++ implementation supports this extension)
or `volatile` to array accesses.

Custom accessors also address concerns relating to heterogeneous memory.
Standard C++ does not have the idea of
"memory spaces that normal code cannot access,"
but many extensions to C++ do have this idea.
For example, a custom accessor could convey accessibility by CPU or GPU threads,
so that the compiler would prevent users from accessing GPU memory
while running on the CPU, or vice versa.
Multiple memory spaces occur in programming models other than for GPUs.
For example, "partitioned global address space" models
have a "global shared memory" that requires special operations to access.
C++ libraries like [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos)
expose access to such memory using an analog of a custom accessor.
Other accessors could expose an array interface
to a persistent storage device that is not directly byte addressable.
We do not propose such accessors here,
but this is a customization point third-party libraries could directly use,
and is available for any future extensions of the C++ standard
for supporting heterogeneous memory.

For a discussion of the idea of accessors and several examples,
please see (Keryell and Falcou 2016).

## Subspan Support

A critical feature of this proposal is `submdspan`,
the subspan or "slicing" function
that returns a view of a subset of an existing `mdspan`.
The result may have any rank up to and including the rank of the input.
All of the aforementioned languages with multidimensional array support
provide subspan capabilities.
Subspans are important because they enable code reuse.
For example, the inner loop in the dense matrix-vector product described above
actually represents a *dot product* -- an inner product of two vectors.
If one already has a function for such an inner product,
then a natural implementation would simply reuse that function.
The LAPACK linear algebra library depends on subspan reuse
for the performance of its one-sided "blocked" matrix factorizations
(Cholesky, LU, and QR).
These factorizations reuse textbook non-blocked algorithms
by calling them on groups of contiguous columns at a time.
This lets LAPACK spend as much time in dense matrix-matrix multiply
(or algorithms with analogous performance) as possible.

## Why propose a multidimensional array view before a container?

Factoring views from containers generally makes sense.
For example, one often sees functions that take `vector` by reference
when they only need to access the `vector`'s elements or call `.size()` on it.
This is one reason for `span`.
Some of us have proposed a multidimensional array container,
`mdarray` [P1684](wg21.link/p1684),
but we have focused on `mdspan` because we consider views more fundamental.

Many fields that compute with multidimensional arrays
rely heavily on shared-memory parallel programming,
where multiple processing units (threads, vector units, etc.)
access different elements of the same array in parallel.
Memory allocation and deallocation are "synchronization points"
for parallel processing units, and thus hinder parallelization.
This makes just *viewing* a multidimensional array,
rather than managing its ownership,
the most fundamental way for parallel computations
to express how they access an array.

It is often necessary to view previously allocated memory as a multidimensional array.
An important special case is when C++ code is calling or being called
from another programming language, such as C, Fortran, or Python.
This use case matters enough to Python that its C API
defines a [Buffer Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html)
for viewing multidimensional arrays across languages.
Language interoperability is key to the success
of the various Python-based data analysis frameworks
built up around NumPy.

## Use multiple-parameter operator[] for array access

We welcome multiple-parameter `operator[]`
as the preferred multidimensional array access operator.
[P1161R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1161r3.html),
now part of C++20, prepared the way for this
by deprecating comma expressions inside `operator[]` invocations.
[P2128R6](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2128r6.pdf),
which proposed changing `operator[]` to accept multiple parameters,
was approved at the October 2021 WG21 Plenary meeting.
Please refer to P2128 for an extensive discussion.

Many existing libraries use the function call `operator()`
for multidimensional array access,
with `operator[]` available for rank-1 (single-dimensional) `mdspan`.
P2128 gives examples.
It's straightforward to adapt these libraries to transition to `mdspan`.
For example, a subclass or wrapper of `mdspan` can provide an `operator()`
that simply forwards to `mdspan::operator[]`.
The subclass or wrapper can then deprecate `operator()`
to help developers find and change all the code that uses it.

[5]{.pnum} `mdspan<ElementType, Extents, LayoutPolicy, AccessorPolicy>` is a trivially copyable type if 
           `AccessorPolicy`, `LayoutPolicy::mapping_type<Extents>` and `AccessorPolicy::pointer` are
           trivially copyable types.

[6]{.pnum} `ElementType` is required to be a complete object type that is neither an abstract class type nor an array type. <!-- mfh 20 Jan 2019: This imitates [span.overview] para 4 wording, with an additional restriction -->

[7]{.pnum} If `Extents` is not a specialization of `extents`, then the program is ill-formed.

[8]{.pnum} If `LayoutPolicy` does not meet the layout mapping policy requirements, then behavior is undefined.

[9]{.pnum} `AccessorPolicy` shall meet the accessor policy requirements.

[10]{.pnum} If `is_same_v<typename AccessorPolicy::element_type,ElementType>` equals `false`, then the program is ill-formed.

<b>22.7.� submdspan [mdspan.submdspan]</b>

[1]{.pnum} `submdspan` creates an `mdspan`
   with a domain that is a subset of the input `mdspan`'s domain,
   and a codomain that is a subset of the input `mdspan`'s codomain.

[2]{.pnum} The `SliceSpecifier` template argument(s)
   and the corresponding value(s) of the arguments of `submdspan` after `src`
   determine the subset of `src` that the `mdspan` returned by `submdspan` views.

```c++

}
```


[3]{.pnum} Let `sub` be the return value of `submdspan(src, slices...)`,
let $s_k$ be the $k$-th element of `slices...`, and
let $S_k$ be the type of the $k$-th element of `slices...`.

[4]{.pnum} Define `map_rank` as an `array<size_t,src.rank()>`
such that for all `j` in the range  `[0, src.rank())` `map_rank[j]` equals `dynamic_extent` 
if `is_convertible_v<`$S_j$`,size_t>` is `true`, or else
`map_rank[j]` equals the number of $S_k$ with $k < j$ such that
`is_convertible_v<`$S_k$`,tuple<size_t,size_t>> || is_convertible_v<`$S_k$`,full_extent_t>` is `true`.

[5]{.pnum} Let `first` and `last` be exposition-only variables of type `array<size_t,src.rank()>`.
For $r$ in the range $[0,$ `src.rank()`$)$,
define the values of `first[r]` and `last[r]` as follows:

  then `first[r]` equals $s_r$, and
  `last[r]` equals `first[r]` + 1;
+ otherwise, if `is_convertible_v<`$S_r$`,tuple<size_t,size_t>>`,
  then `first[r]` equals `get<0>(t)`, and `last[r]` equals `get<1>(t)`,
  where `t` is the result of converting $s_r$ to `tuple<size_t,size_t>`;
+ otherwise, if `is_convertible_v<`$S_r$`,full_extent_t>`,
  then `first[r]` equals `0`, and `last[r]` equals `src.extent(r)`.

[6]{.pnum} *Constraints:*

* `sizeof(slices...)` equals `src.rank()`,

   each of which meets the requirements of a layout mapping policy

  such that `is_convertible_v<`$S_k$`,tuple<size_t,size_t>> || is_convertible_v<`$S_k$`,full_extent_t>` is `true`.
* Let the pack `i...` denote a multidimensional index in the domain of `src` with $i_k$ denoting the $k$-th element of `i...`, such that
  $i_k$ is greater than or equal to `first[k]` and $i_k$ is less than `last[k]` for all `k` in the range $[0,$`src.rank()`$)$.
  Let the pack `j...` denote a multidimensional index in the domain of `sub` with $j_s$ denoting the $s$-th element of `j...`, such that
  $j_s$ is equal to $i_k$ minus `first[k]` where `map_rank[k]` equals `s` for all `s` in the range $[0,$`sub.rank()`$)$.
  Then `sub(j...)` and `src(i...)` refer to the same element in the codomain of `src`.
* For $0\:\le$ `k` < `src.rank()`, if `map_rank[k] != dynamic_extent` is `true`, then
  `sub.extent(map_rank[k])` equals `last[k] - first[k]`.
* If `src.is_strided()` is `true`, then `sub.is_strided()` is `true`,

* If `LayoutPolicy` is `layout_left` and `sub.rank()` is `0`, then
  `decltype(sub)::layout_type` is `layout_left`.
* If `LayoutPolicy` is `layout_right` and `sub.rank() > 0` is `true`, then:

    `k` in the range $[$`src.rank()-sub.rank()+1`$,$`src.rank()`$)$ and

[9]{.pnum} *Effects:*

* Direct-non-list-initializes `sub.`_`acc_`_ with `src.accessor()`.
* Direct-non-list-initializes `sub.`_`ptr_`_ with `src.accessor().offset(src.data(),apply(src.mapping(),first))`.
