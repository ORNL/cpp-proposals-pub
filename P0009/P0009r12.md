# Revision History

## D0009r13: anticipating 2021-10 Mailing

LEWG reviewed P0009r12 together with P2299r3 on 2021-06-08.

<b>LEWG Poll</b> Approve the direction of P2299R3 and merge it into P0009.

Attendance: 25; Number of authors: 1 [presumably for P2299, as P0009 coauthors were also attending]; Author's Position: SF.

- Incorporated changes proposed by P2299r3
  - Added `dextents` alias
  - Removed `mdspan` alias and renamed `basic_mdspan` to `mdspan`
    (which is now a class type, not an alias).
    This undoes a change introduced in P0009r6.
    P2299r3 explains the rationale.
    Existing code using the `mdspan` alias will need to change
    by replacing the list of extents template arguments with a single `extents` type.
  - Added `mdspan` deduction guides
  - As needed for deduction guides, added `layout_type` alias
    to layout mapping requirements and to `layout_left`, `layout_right`, and `layout_stride`
- Adapted new LWG wording guidelines by replacing "Expects" with "Preconditions"
- Minor formatting corrections

## P0009r12: post 2021-05 Mailing
- Fixed definition of `static_extent`
- Added converting constructor for `default_accessor` (when the pointers to
  elements are convertible) for things like `default_accessor<double>` to `default_accessor<const double>`
- Changed [mdspan.accessor.basic] to [mdspan.accessor.default], to correspond with the name change
  in P0009r11
- Minor formatting corrections

## P0009r11: 2021-05 Mailing

- Ask LEWG to poll on targeting P0009 for C++23
- Change all the sizes from `ptrdiff_t` to `size_t` and `index_type` to `size_type`,
  for consistency with `span` and the rest of the standard library`
- Renamed `IndexType` to `SizeType` or `SizeTypes` (depending if it is a single
  type or a parameter pack)
- Changed comparisons to hidden friends
- Explicitly mention which types are trivially copyable or empty.  This is important as
  a major intended use case for this is heterogeneous computing.
  A trivially copyable is heavily used as a proxy for types which can be copied between a host (such as a CPU)
  and a device (such as a GPU) or between two devices by just copying the bytes which make up the object
  representation of the type.
  If they are not trivially copyable, heterogeneous computing would not be able to use these types as vocabulary types.
- State the conditions that make `basic_mdspan` trivially default constructible
- In `layout_*` types, made `operator()` and `stride()` constexpr
- In `layout_stride`, made assignment operators and `required_span_size()` constexpr
  to match the other `layout_*` types
- Renamed `subspan` to `submdspan`, as this only applies to `mdspan`
- Made `submdspan()` constexpr
- Tweak the wording of `is_strided`
- Renamed `all_type` to `full_extent_t` and `all` to `full_extent`
- Renamed `accessor_basic` to `default_accessor`
- Removed accessor policy `decay(p)` member function as it was an artifact 
  from an earlier version of this proposal when `basic_mdspan` had a `span()`
  member function that returned a `std::span`
- Removed `span()` from [mdspan.basic.members] description as `.span()` was removed
  from an earlier version of this proposal

## P0009r10: Pre 2020-02-Prague Mailing

- Switched to  mpark/wg21 pandoc format
- Add general description of span and mdspan
- Removed `mdspan_subspan` expo only type; use `basic_mdspan<`*see below*`>` instead
- Fixed typos in accessor table
- Made editorial changes to wording based on San Diego feedback
- Updated operational semantics subsection heading based on new style guidelines


## P0009r9: Pre 2019-02-Kona Mailing

- Wording fixes based on guidance: [LWG small group at 2018-11-SanDiego](http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21sandiego2018/SanDiego2018P0009)

## P0009r8: Pre 2018-11-SanDiego Mailing

- Refinement based upon updated [prototype](https://github.com/ORNL/cpp-proposals-pub/blob/master/P0009/prototype) / reference implementation

## P0009r7: Post 2018-06-Rapperswil Mailing

- wording reworked based on guidance: [LWG review at 2018-06-Rapperswil](http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21rapperswil2018/LWGSatAM)
- usage of `span` requires reference to C++20 working draft
- namespace for library TS `std::experimental::fundamentals_v3`

# Description

The proposed polymorphic multidimensional array reference (`mdspan`)
defines types and functions for mapping multidimensional indices
in its *domain*, a
multidimensional index space, to the `mdspan`'s *codomain*,
elements of a contiguous span of objects.
A *multidimensional index space* of *rank* <math>R</math>
is the Cartesian product
<math>[0, N<sub>0</sub>) &#10799; [0, N<sub>1</sub>) &#10799; ... &#10799; [0, N<sub>R-1</sub>)</math>
of half-open integer intervals.
A *multidimensional index*
is a element of a multidimensional index space.
An `mdspan` has two policies: the *layout mapping*
and the *accessor*. The layout mapping specifies the formula, and
properties of the formula, for mapping a multidimensional index from the domain to
an element in the codomain. The accessor is an extension point that
allows modification of how elements are accessed. For example,
\[P0367](http://wg21.link/p0367)
proposed a rich set of potential access properties.

<b>The Need for multidimensional arrays</b>
Multidimensional arrays are fundamental data structures in numerous fields, 
including graphics, mathematics, engineering and general science.
As a consequence they are a primary language concept in many general purpose 
(e.g. Python/NumPy, Fortran) and special purpose languages (e.g. Matlab, Julia).
In fact Fortran had multidimensional arrays as part of its language definition since version I.
Lately they also have been integral to the newly prominent fields of AI and Machine Learning processing. 
In fact, one of the predominant Machine Learning libraries is called TensorFlow - and tensors are the quintessiental multidimensional arrays. 

<b>A multidimensional array is not an array-of-array-of-array-of...</b>

The multidimensional array abstraction has been fundamental to numerical
computations for over five decades. However, the C/C++ language provides
only a one-dimensional array abstraction which can be composed into
array-of-array-of-array-of... types. While such types have some similarity
to multidimensional arrays, they do not provide adequate multidimensional
array functionality of this proposal. Two critical functionality
differences are (1) multiple dynamic extents and (2) polymorphic mapping
of multidimensional indices to element objects.

<b>Why propose array view before container</b>

One commonality of the above mentioned fields is, that they all rely heavily on 
parallel programming, where threads access common data.
Thus view-like semantics express the data ownership semantics - or the lack thereof - better.
Furthermore, often it is necessary to view pre-existing data as multidimensional views, 
sometimes with different shapes depending on the operation.
Last but not least, it is very common in the above use cases to require language interoperability, 
with parts of the application written in one language and others in a different language. 
In those cases data is handed over via simple pointers, with the appropriate shaping as 
multidimensional arrays being superimposed. 

<b>Mixing Compile-Time and Run-Time Dimensions </b>

The fundamental reason to allow for compile time dimensions is performance.
Knowing an extent at compile time enables a number of compiler optimizations,
such as unrolling and pre-computing of offsets, which can significantly 
improve the generated code.
Furthermore in a number of areas some dimensions are more naturally expressed via 
compile time extents. 
For example in many physics and engineering algorithms some dimensions are dictated 
by fundamental properties of the physical world or the discretization scheme.
The position of a particle in space requries a vector of extents three, since 
physical space is three-dimensional.
At the same time other extents are only known at runtime, such as the number of 
particles in a simulation. 
Similarly in Graphics, some of the most fundamental objects are 2x2 or 3x3 matrices. 
Not carrying around the extents as members is important to conserve register and stack space.

<b>Customizable Layout Mappings</b>

One important aspect of allowing customizable layouts is language interoperability.
C++ arrays have a prescribed layout in memory, with the right most index providing stride-1 access 
to the underlying memory. Fortran arrays also have a prescribed layout, however its left most 
dimension is providing stride-1 access in memory, the opposite of the C layout.
Python's NumPy arrays have a configurable layout, to provide compatibility with both C and Fortran.

Beyond language interoperability controling the layout can also be used to enable performant memory
access patterns which may depend on the hardware. Consider the following small code which performs a 
matrix-vector product using parallel algorithms:
```
mdspan<double,extents<N,M>,layout> A = ...;
mdspan<double,extents<N>> y = ...;
mdspan<double,extents<M>> x = ...;

std::for_each(std::par_unseq, std::counting_iterator<int>(0,N), 
  [=](int i) {
     double sum = 0.0;
     for(int j=0; j<M; j++) sum += A(i,j) * x(j);
     y(i) = sum;
  });

```

On CPU like architecture this code performs well with a C-like layout. However
when offloading the `for_each` to GPUs (which NVIDIA's nvc++ compiler for example does)
a Fortran-like layout performs much better, since it will enable coalesced data access
on `A`.

However, it is not enough to have just C-like and Fortran-like memory mappings.
For example viewing a column of a matrix in C-layout, requires a mapping which expresses
the stride between elements of the column. The same is true for viewing a sub-tensor of a higher dimensional tensor.
Furthermore, sometimes there are significant performance benefits to be gained by having 
even more complex layouts.
One such index mapping is using tiling to improve data locality for common stencil data access patterns.
Another reason for tiled layouts is to improve vectorization. For example, Intel's Math Kernel Library
introduced the Vectorized Compact Routines which provide batched matrix operations, where a number
of matrices are interleaved, such that vectorized memory access can be performed optimally.
Another design goal for the customizable layouts is to allow for non-unique layouts.
This allows multiple index tuples to point to the same memory location. One of its uses is
to express symmetric data structures, for example symmetric matrices where the value of 
`A(i,j)` must be the same as `A(j,i)`.

<b>Why Customizable Accessors</b>

The accessor concept proposed here, serves as a customization point to provide more
information to the compiler, or allow the injection of special data access modes. 
Today most hardware implementations provide more instructions to access data than 
a simple read and write.
These include for example instructions which affect caching behavior - such as 
non-temporal, or even non-coherent loads and stores. 
Other instructions exist to do hardware provided atomic accesses.
An important information conveyed to compilers is whether data arrays alias each
other in some context. Thus C introduced the restrict qualifier in its C99 standard.
The volatile keyword is yet another qualifier which in C restricts what kind of 
compiler optimizations can be done, and thus is often used in parallel programming, 
to ensure (eventual) visbility of memory operations to other threads.

Another concern accessors can address is the emergence of various memory spaces
in modern machines. For example custom accessors can convey accessibility by
host or GPU threads in a typesafe manner, in todays common heterogeneous machines. 
While we don't propose such accessors here, it is a customization point third party
libraries could directly use, and is available for eventual extensions of the C++ 
standard to support such heterogeneous memory.

<b> Subspan Support </b>

Another aspect of this proposal is the capability to get multi dimensional subspans.
This includes subspans which maintain the rank of the original array and ones which 
reduce the rank. 
It is worth noting that all the above mentioned languages with multidimensional array
support also provide subspan capabilities.
One important reason for this is that subspans enable code reuse.
For example the inner loop in the above described matrix-vector product actually 
represents a *dot product* - an inner product of two vectors.
If one already has a function for such an inner product, then using it by obtaining 
each row of the matrix as a subspan allows its reuse.

<b>22.7.� Overview [mdspan.overview]</b>

[1]{.pnum} A _multidimensional index space_ is a Cartesian product of integer intervals.
Each interval can be represented by a half-open range $[I_b, I_e)$, where $I_b$ and $I_e$ are the lower and upper bounds of the $i^{th}$ dimension.
The _rank_ of a multidimensional index space is the number of intervals it represents.

[2]{.pnum} A _multidimensional index_ is an element within the a multidimensional
index space and can be represented as a pack of integer types. 
The multidimensional index `idx...` refers to an element within the domain of a multidimensional index space if both the following are true:

  * [2.1]{.pnum} `sizeof...(idx)` is equal to rank, and

  * [2.2]{.pnum} For all $i$ in the range $[0,$rank$)$, the $i^{th}$ value of `idx` is in the range $[I_b, I_e)$.

[3]{.pnum} For the following subsections, let $r$ be a value in the range $[0,$rank$)$. 

[4]{.pnum} `full_extent_t` is an empty class type.

<b>22.7.�.2 Overview [mdspan.extents.overview]</b>

[1]{.pnum} The class template `extents` represents a multidimensional index space
of rank equal to `sizeof...(Extents)`. 

[2]{.pnum} `extents<Extents...>` is a trivially copyable type.

[3]{.pnum} $E_r$ is a _dynamic extent_ if it is equal to `dynamic_extent`, otherwise $E_r$ is a _static extent_.
For each $E_r$ equivalent to `dynamic_extent`,  
the upper bound of the interval is stored in the exposition-only array `dynamic_extents_` at
`dynamic_extents_[dynamic_index(`_r_`)]`.

[4]{.pnum} If $E_r$ is a dynamic extent, let $D_r$ be the value of `dynamic_extents_[dynamic_index(`_r_`)]`.
The $r^{th}$ interval of an `extents` is as follows: 
  
  * [4.1]{.pnum} $[0, E_r)$ if $E_r$ is a static extent,
  
  * [4.2]{.pnum} otherwise $[0, D_r)$. 

---

```cpp
constexpr size_t dynamic_index(size_t i) noexcept; // @_exposition only_@
```

* [5]{.pnum} *Returns*: If `i <= sizeof...(Extents)` is `true`, returns the number of arguments 
before the `i`_th_ template parameter in the template parameter pack `Extents` 
equivalent to `dynamic_extent`.  Otherwise, returns `rank_dynamic()`.

<b>22.7.� Class template `mdspan` [mdspan.basic]</b>

<br/>
<b>22.7.�.1 `mdspan` overview [mdspan.basic.overview]</b>

[1]{.pnum} `mdspan` maps a multidimensional index in its domain
   to a reference to an element in its codomain `span`.

[2]{.pnum} The *domain* of an `mdspan` object is a multidimensional index space defined by an `extents`.

[3]{.pnum} The *codomain* of an `mdspan` object is a `span` of elements.

[4]{.pnum} As with `span`, the storage of the objects in the codomain `span` of an `mdspan` is owned by some other object.

<b>22.7.� submdspan [mdspan.submdspan]</b>

[1]{.pnum} `submdspan` creates an `mdspan`
   with a domain that is a subset of the input `mdspan`'s domain,
   and a codomain that is a subset of the input `mdspan`'s codomain.

[2]{.pnum} The `SliceSpecifier` template argument(s)
   and the corresponding value(s) of the arguments of `submdspan` after `src`
   determine the subset of `src` that the `mdspan` returned by `submdspan` views.

```cpp
namespace std {

  // [mdspan.submdspan], submdspan creation

                             AccessorPolicy>& src, SliceSpecifiers... slices) noexcept;
}
```


[3]{.pnum} Let `sub` be the return value of `submdspan(src, slices...)`,
let $s_k$ be the $k$-th element of `slices...`, and
let $S_k$ be the type of the $k$-th element of `slices...`.

[4]{.pnum} Define `map_rank` as an `array<size_t,src.rank()>`
such that `map_rank[j]` equals `dynamic_extent` if `is_convertible_v<`$S_j$`,size_t>` is `true`, or else
`map_rank[j]` equals the number of $S_k$ with $k < j$ such that
`is_convertible_v<`$S_k$`,pair<size_t,size_t>> || is_convertible_v<`$S_k$`,full_extent_t>` is `true`.

[5]{.pnum} Let `first` and `last` be exposition-only variables of type `array<size_t,src.rank()>`.
For $r$ in the range $[0,$ `src.rank()`$)$,
define the values of `first[r]` and `last[r]` as follows:

+ if `is_convertible_v<`$S_r$`,size_t>`,
  then `first[r]` equals $s_r$, and
  `last[r]` equals `first[r]` + 1;
+ otherwise, if `is_convertible_v<`$S_r$`,pair<size_t,size_t>>`,
  then `first[r]` equals `p.first`, and `last[r]` equals `p.second`,
  where `p` is the result of converting $s_r$ to `pair<size_t,size_t>`;
+ otherwise, if `is_convertible_v<`$S_r$`,full_extent_t>`,
  then `first[r]` equals `0`, and `last[r]` equals `src.extent(r)`.

[6]{.pnum} *Constraints:*

* `sizeof(slices...)` equals `src.rank()`,
* `LayoutPolicy` is `layout_left`, `layout_right`, `layout_stride`,
   or any type in a possibly empty set of implementation-defined types,
   each of which meets the requirements of a layout mapping policy
   <b>[mdspan.layout.reqs]</b>
   <i>[Note:</i> Implementation and user defined layout mapping policies could exist,
   for which taking an arbitrary `submdspan` does not make sense. <i>— end note]</i>;

[7]{.pnum} *Preconditions:*

* For $0\:\le$ `r` < `src.rank()`,

  such that `is_convertible_v<`$S_k$`,pair<size_t,size_t>> || is_convertible_v<`$S_k$`,full_extent_t>` is `true`.
* Let the pack `i...` denote a multidimensional index in the domain of `src` with $i_k$ denoting the $k$-th element of `i...`, such that
  $i_k$ is greater than or equal to `first[k]` and $i_k$ is less than `last[k]` for all `k` in the range $[0,$`src.rank()`$)$.
  Let the pack `j...` denote a multidimensional index in the domain of `sub` with $j_s$ denoting the $s$-th element of `j...`, such that
  $j_s$ is equal to $i_k$ minus `first[k]` where `map_rank[k]` equals `s` for all `s` in the range $[0,$`sub.rank()`$)$.
  Then `sub(j...)` and `src(i...)` refer to the same element in the codomain of `src`.
* For $0\:\le$ `k` < `src.rank()`, if `map_rank[k] != -1` is `true`, then
  `sub.extent(map_rank[k])` equals `last[k] - first[k]`.
* If `src.is_strided()` is `true`, then `sub.is_strided()` is `true`,
  and for all `k` in the range `[0, src.rank())`, if `map_rank[k] != -1` is `true`, then
  `sub.stride(map_rank[k])` equals `src.stride(k)`.
* For all `k` in the range `[0, src.rank())`, if `map_rank[k] != -1` is `true` and 
  `src.static_extent(k)` does not equal `dynamic_extent` and
  `is_convertible_v<`$S_k$`,full_extent_t>` is `true`,
  then `sub.static_extent(map_rank[k])` equals `src.static_extent(k)`.

Next Steps
==========

We would like LEWG to poll on sending P0009 ('mdspan') to LWG for C++23 instead of
C++ Library Fundamentals Technical Specification version 3, classified as an addition
(P0592R4 bucket 3 item).

If [P2128 Multidimensional subscript operator](https://wg21.link/P2128/) is also adopted into C++23, we will
propose that `mdspan::operator()` be replaced with `mdspan::operator[]` for C++23.


Implementation
============

There is an mdspan implementation available at [https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan/](https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan/).
