Title: Padded mdspan layouts
Shortname: P2642
Status: iso/P
Level: 1
Group: WG21

Editor: Mark Hoemmen, NVIDIA, mhoemmen@nvidia.com
Abstract: We propose two new mdspan layouts, layout_left_padded and layout_right_padded.  These are strided layouts where the leftmost resp. rightmost extent is always stride 1, but the next stride to the right resp. left can be larger than the leftmost resp. rightmost extent.  The new layouts can represent this "padding stride" as either a compile-time or a run-time value.  We also propose adding submdspan (P2630) support for these layouts, and changing P2630 so that submdspan of a layout_left resp. layout_right mdspan produces a layout_left_padded resp. layout_right_padded mdspan whenever possible.

    * Change padding stride to function as an overalignment factor
        if less than the extent to pad.  Remove mapping constructor
        that takes `extents_type` and
        `extents<index_type, padding_stride>`,
        because the latter may not be the actual padding stride.

    * Make converting constructors from `layout_{left,right}_padded::mapping` to `layout_{left,right}::mapping` use Mandates rather than Constraints to check compile-time stride compatibility.

    * Mandate that `layout_{left,right}_padded::mapping`'s actual padding stride, if known at compile time, be representable as a value of type `index_type` (as well as of type `size_t`, the previous requirement).

    * Add section explaining why we don't permit conversion from more aligned to less aligned.

    * Fixed typos in Wording

    * Fix formatting in non-Wording, and add links for BLAS and LAPACK

# Proposed changes and justification

## Summary of proposed changes

We propose two new mdspan layouts,
`layout_left_padded` and `layout_right_padded`.
These layouts support two use cases:

1. array layouts that are contiguous in one dimension,
    as supported by commonly used libraries
    like the <a href="https://netlib.org/blas/blast-forum/">BLAS</a>
    (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines;
    see P1417 and P1674 for historical overview and references)
    and <a href="https://netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> (Linear Algebra PACKage); and

2. "padded" storage for overaligned access
    of the start of every contiguous segment of the array.

We also propose changing `submdspan`
of a `layout_left` resp. `layout_right` mdspan
to return `layout_left_padded` resp. `layout_right_padded`
instead of `layout_stride`, when the slice arguments permit it.

## Two new mdspan layouts

The two new mdspan layouts `layout_left_padded` and `layout_right_padded`
are strided, unique layouts.
If the rank is zero or one,
then the layouts behave exactly like `layout_left` resp. `layout_right`.
If the rank is two or more,
then the layouts implement a special case of `layout_stride`
where only one stride may differ from the extent
that in `layout_left` resp. `layout_right` would completely define the stride.
We call that stride the *padding stride*,
and the extent that in `layout_left` resp. `layout_right`
would define it the *extent to pad*.
The padding stride of `layout_left_padded` is `stride(1)`,
and the extent to pad is `extent(0)`.
The padding stride of `layout_right_padded` is `stride(rank() - 2)`,
and the extent to pad is `extent(rank() - 1)`.
All other strides of `layout_left_padded` are the same as in `layout_left`,
and all other strides of `layout_right_padded` are the same as in `layout_right`.

### Optimizations over `layout_stride`

The two new layouts offer the following optimizations over `layout_stride`.

1. They guarantee at compile time
    that one extent always has stride-1 access.
    While `layout_stride`'s member functions are all `constexpr`,
    its mapping constructor takes the strides as a `std::array`
    with `rank()` size.

2. They do not need to store any strides
    if the padding stride is known at compile time.
    Even if the padding stride is a run-time value,
    these layouts only need to store the one stride value (as `index_type`).
    The `layout_stride::mapping` class must store all `rank()` stride values.

### New layouts unify two use cases

The proposed layouts unify two different use cases:

1. overaligned access to the beginning
    of each contiguous segment of elements, and

2. representing exactly the data layout assumed by
    the General (GE) matrix type in the BLAS' C binding.

Regarding (1), an appropriate choice of padding
can ensure any desired overalignment
of the beginning of each contiguous segment of elements in an mdspan,
as long as the entire memory allocation has the same overalignment.
This is useful for hardware features that require
or perform better with overaligned access,
such as SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions.

Regarding (2), the padding stride is the same as
BLAS' "leading dimension" of the matrix (`LDA`) argument.
Unlike `layout_left` and `layout_right`,
any subview of a contiguous subset of rows and columns
of a rank-2 `layout_left_padded` or `layout_right_padded` mdspan
preserves the layout.
For example, if `A` is a rank-2 mdspan
whose layout is `layout_left_padded<padding_stride>`,
then `submdspan(A, tuple{r1, r2}, tuple{c1, c2})`
also has layout `layout_left_padded<padding_stride>`
with the same padding stride as before.
The BLAS and algorithms that use it
(such as the blocked algorithms in LAPACK)
depend on this ability to operate on contiguous submatrices
with the same layout as their parent.
For this reason, we can replace the `layout_blas_general` layout in
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1673r9.html">P1673R9</a>
with `layout_left_padded` and `layout_right_padded`.
Making most effective use of the new layouts in code that uses P1673
calls for integrating them with `submdspan`.
This is why we propose the following changes as well.

### Design change from R0

A design change from R0 of this paper makes this overalignment case
easier to use and more like the existing `std::assume_aligned` interface.
In R0 of this paper, the user's padding input parameter
(either a compile-time `padding_stride` or a run-time value)
was exactly the padding stride.
As such, it had to be greater than or equal to the extent to pad.
For example, if users had an `extent(0)` of 13
and wanted to overalign the corresponding `stride(1)` to a multiple of 4,
they would have had to specify `layout_left_padded<16>`.
This was inconsistent with `std::assume_aligned`,
whose template argument (the byte alignment)
would need to be `4 * sizeof(element_type)`.
Also, users who wanted a compile-time padding stride
would have needed to compute it themselves
from the corresponding compile-time extent,
rather than prespecifying a fixed overalignment factor
that could be used for any extent.
This was not only harder to use, but it made the layout itself
(not just the layout mapping) depend on the extent.
That was inconsistent with the existing mdspan layouts,
where the layout type itself (e.g., `layout_left`)
is always a function from `extents` specialization to layout mapping.

In this version of the paper,
we interpret the case where the input padding stride
is less than the extent to pad
as an "overalignment factor" instead of a stride.
To revisit the above example,
`layout_left_padded<4>` would take an `extent(0)` of 13
and round up the corresponding `stride(1)` to 16.
However, as before,
`layout_left_padded<17>` would take an `extent(0)` of 13
and round up the corresponding `stride(1)` to 17.
The rule is consistent: the actual padding stride is always
the next multiple of the input padding stride
greater than or equal to the extent-to-pad.

In R0 of this paper, the following alias

```c++
using overaligned_matrix_t =
  mdspan<float, dextents<size_t, 2>, layout_right_padded<4>>;
```

would only be meaningful if the run-time extents are less than or equal to 4.
In this version of the paper, this alias would always mean
"the padding stride rounds up the rightmost extent to a multiple of 4,
whatever the extent may be."
R0 had no way to express that use case
with a compile-time input padding stride.
This is important for hardware features and compiler optimizations
that require overalignment of multidimensional arrays.

### Padding stride equality for layout mapping conversions

`layout_left_padded<padding_stride>::mapping<Extents>`
has a converting constructor from
`layout_left_padded<other_padding_stride>::mapping<OtherExtents>`.
Similarly, `layout_right_padded<padding_stride>::mapping<Extents>`
has a converting constructor from
`layout_right_padded<other_padding_stride>::mapping<OtherExtents>`.
These constructors require, among other conditions,
that if `padding_stride` and `other_padding_stride` do not equal `dynamic_extent`,
then `padding_stride` equals `other_padding_stride`.

Users may ask why they can't convert a more overaligned mapping,
such as `layout_left_padded<4>::mapping`,
to a less overaligned mapping, such as `layout_left_padded<2>::mapping`.
The problem is that this may not be correct for all extents.
For example, the following code would be incorrect
if it were well formed (it is not, in this proposal).

```c++
layout_left_padded<4>::mapping m_orig{extents{9, 2}};
layout_left_padded<2>::mapping m_new(m_orig);
```

The issue is that `m_orig` has an underlying ("physical") layout of `extents{12, 2}`,
but `layout_left_padded<2>::mapping{extents{9, 2}}`
would have an underlying layout of `extents{10, 2}`.
That is,
`layout_left_padded<4>::mapping{extents{9, 2}}.stride(1)` is 12,
but `layout_left_padded<2>::mapping{extents{9, 2}}.stride(1)` is 10.

In case one is tempted to permit
assigning dynamic padding stride to static padding stride,
the following code would also be incorrect
if it were well formed (it is not, in this proposal).
Again, `m_orig.stride(1)` is 12.

```c++
layout_left_padded<dynamic_extent>::mapping m_orig{extents{9, 2}, 4};
layout_left_padded<2>::mapping m_new(m_orig);
```

The following code is well formed in this proposal,
and it gives `m_new` the expected original padding stride of 12.

```c++
layout_left_padded<dynamic_extent>::mapping m_orig{extents{9, 2}, 4};
layout_left_padded<dynamic_extent>::mapping m_new(m_orig);
```

Similarly, the following code is well formed in this proposal,
and it gives `m_new` the expected original padding stride of 12.

```c++
layout_left_padded<4>::mapping m_orig{extents{9, 2}};
layout_left_padded<dynamic_extent>::mapping m_new(m_orig);
```

## Integration with `submdspan`

We propose changing `submdspan`
(<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2630r0.html">see P2630</a>)
of a `layout_left` resp. `layout_right` mdspan
to return `layout_left_padded` resp. `layout_right_padded`
instead of `layout_stride`, if the slice arguments permit it.
Taking the `submdspan` of a `layout_left_padded` resp. `layout_right_padded` mdspan
will preserve the layout, again if the slice arguments permit it. 

The phrase "if the slice arguments permit it" means the following.

### `layout_left_padded` and `layout_left` cases

In what follows, let `left_submatrix` be the following function,

```c++
template<class Elt, class Extents, class Layout, class Accessor, class S0, class S1>
requires(
  is_convertible_v<S0,
    tuple<typename Extents::index_type, typename Extents::index_type>> &&
  is_convertible_v<S1,
    tuple<typename Extents::index_type, typename Extents::index_type>>
)
auto left_submatrix(mdspan<Elt, Extents, Layout, Accessor> X, S0 s0, S1 s1)
{
  auto full_extents = []<size_t ... Indices>(index_sequence<Indices...>) {
      return tuple{ (Indices, full_extent)... };
    }(make_index_sequence<X.rank() - 2>());
  return apply( [&](full_extent_t ... fe) {
      return submdspan(X, s0, s1, fe...);
    }, full_extents );
}
```

let `index_type` be an integral type,
let `s0` be an object of a type `S0` such that
`is_convertible_v<S0, tuple<index_type, index_type>>` is `true`,
and let `s1` be an object of a type `S1` such that
`is_convertible_v<S1, tuple<index_type, index_type>>` is `true`.

Let `X` be an `mdspan` with rank at least two
with `decltype(X)::index_type` naming the same type as `index_type`,
whose layout is `layout_left_padded<padding_stride_X>`
for some `constexpr size_t padding_stride_X`.
Let `X_sub` be the object returned from `left_submatrix(X, s0, s1)`.
Then, `X_sub` is an `mdspan` of rank `X.rank()`
with layout `layout_left_padded<padding_stride_X>`,
and `X_sub.stride(1)` equals `X.stride(1)`.

Let `Z` be an `mdspan` with rank at least two
with `decltype(Z)::index_type` naming the same type as `index_type`,
whose layout is `layout_left`.
Let `Z_sub` be the object returned from `left_submatrix(Z, s0, s1)`.
Then, `Z_sub` is an `mdspan` of rank `Z.rank()`
with layout `layout_left_padded<padding_stride_Z>`,
where `padding_stride_Z` is

* `srm1_val1 - srm1_val0`, if `srm1` is convertible to
    `tuple<integral_constant<decltype(W)::index_type, srm1_val0>, integral_constant<decltype(W)::index_type, srm1_val1>>`
    with `srm1_val1` greater than to equal to `srm1_val0`; else,

* `dynamic_rank`.

Also, `Z_sub.stride(1)` equals `Z.stride(1)`.

### `layout_right_padded` and `layout_right` cases

In what follows, let `right_submatrix` be the following function,

```c++
template<class Elt, class Extents, class Layout, class Accessor, class Srm2, class Srm1>
requires(
  is_convertible_v<Srm2,
    tuple<typename Extents::index_type, typename Extents::index_type>> &&
  is_convertible_v<Srm1,
    tuple<typename Extents::index_type, typename Extents::index_type>>
)
auto left_submatrix(mdspan<Elt, Extents, Layout, Accessor> X, Srm2 srm2, Srm1 srm1)
{
  auto full_extents = []<size_t ... Indices>(index_sequence<Indices...>) {
      return tuple{ (Indices, full_extent)... };
    }(make_index_sequence<X.rank() - 2>());
  return apply( [&](full_extent_t ... fe) {
      return submdspan(X, fe..., srm2, srm1);
    }, full_extents );
}
```

let `srm2` ("s of rank minus 2") be an object of a type `Srm2` such that
`is_convertible_v<S0, tuple<index_type_X, index_type_X>>` is `true`,
and let `srm1` ("s of rank minus 1") be an object of a type `Srm1` such that
`is_convertible_v<S1, tuple<index_type_X, index_type_X>>` is `true`.


Similarly, let `Y` be an `mdspan` with rank at least two
whose layout is `layout_right_padded<padding_stride_Y>`
for some `constexpr size_t padding_stride_Y`.
Let `index_type_Y` name the type `decltype(Y)::index_type`.
Let `srm2` ("S of rank minus 2") be an object of a type `Srm2` such that
`is_convertible_v<Srm2, tuple<index_type_Y, index_type_Y>>` is `true`,
and let `srm1` ("S of rank minus 1") be an object of a type `Srm1` such that
`is_convertible_v<Srm1, tuple<index_type_Y, index_type_Y>>` is `true`.
In the following code fragment,

```c++
auto full_extents = []<size_t ... Indices>(index_sequence<Indices...>) {
    return tuple{ (Indices, full_extent)... };
  }(make_index_sequence<Y.rank() - 2>());

auto Y_sub = apply( [&](full_extent_t ... fe) {
    return submdspan(Y, fe..., srm2, srm1);
  }, full_extents );
```

`Y_sub` is an `mdspan` of rank `Y.rank()`
with layout `layout_left_padded<padding_stride>`,
and `Y_sub.stride(1)` equals `Y.stride(1)`.

Let `Z` be an `mdspan` with rank at least two whose layout is `layout_left`.
Let `index_type_Z` name the type `decltype(Z)::index_type`.
Let `s0` be an object of a type `S0` such that
`is_convertible_v<S0, tuple<index_type_Z, index_type_Z>>` is `true`,
and let `s1` be an object of a type `S1` such that
`is_convertible_v<S1, tuple<index_type_Z, index_type_Z>>` is `true`.
In the following code fragment,

```c++
auto full_extents = []<size_t ... Indices>(index_sequence<Indices...>) {
    return tuple{ (Indices, full_extent)... };
  }(make_index_sequence<Z.rank() - 2>());

auto Z_sub = apply( [&](full_extent_t ... fe) {
    return submdspan(Z, s0, s1, fe...);
  }, full_extents );
```

`Z_sub` is an `mdspan` of rank `Z.rank()`
with layout `layout_left_padded<padding_stride_Z>`,
where `padding_stride_Z` is `s0_val1 - s0_val0`
if `s0` is convertible to `tuple<integral_constant<index_type_Z, s0_val0>, integral_constant<index_type_Z, s0_val1>>`
with `s0_val1` greater than to equal to `s0_val0`.
Also, `Z_sub.stride(1)` equals `Z.stride(1)`.

Similarly, let `W` be an `mdspan` with rank at least two whose layout is `layout_right`.
Let `index_type_W` name the type `decltype(W)::index_type`.
Let `srm2` ("S of rank minus 2") be an object of a type `Srm2` such that
`is_convertible_v<Srm2, tuple<index_type_W, index_type_W>>` is `true`,
and let `srm1` ("S of rank minus 1") be an object of a type `Srm1` such that
`is_convertible_v<Srm1, tuple<index_type_W, index_type_W>>` is `true`.
In the following code fragment,

```c++
auto full_extents = []<size_t ... Indices>(index_sequence<Indices...>) {
    return tuple{ (Indices, full_extent)... };
  }(make_index_sequence<W.rank() - 2>());

auto W_sub = apply( [&](full_extent_t ... fe) {
    return submdspan(W, fe..., srm2, srm1);
  }, full_extents );
```

`W_sub` is an `mdspan` of rank `W.rank()`
with layout `layout_left_padded<padding_stride_W>`,
where `padding_stride_W` is `srm1_val1 - srm1_val0`
if `srm1` is convertible to `tuple<integral_constant<index_type_W, srm1_val0>, integral_constant<index_type_W, srm1_val1>>`
with `srm1_val1` greater than to equal to `srm1_val0`.
Also, `W_sub.stride(1)` equals `W.stride(1)`.

Preservation of these layouts under `submdspan`
is an important feature for our linear algebra library proposal P1673,
because it means that for existing BLAS and LAPACK use cases,
if we start with one of these layouts,
we know that we can implement fast linear algebra algorithms
by calling directly into an optimized C or Fortran BLAS.

## Examples

### Directly call C BLAS without checks

We show examples before and after this proposal of functions
that compute the matrix-matrix product `C += A * B`.
The `recursive_matrix_product` function computes this product recursively,
by partitioning each of the three matrices into a 2 x 2 block matrix
using the `partition` function.
When the `C` matrix is small enough,
`recursive_matrix_product` stops recursing
and instead calls a `base_case_matrix_product` function
with different overloads for different matrix layouts.
If the matrix layouts support it, `base_case_matrix_product`
can call the C BLAS function `cblas_sgemm` directly on the `mdspan`s' data.
This is fast if the C BLAS is optimized.
Otherwise, `base_case_matrix_product` falls back to a slow generic implementation.

This example is far from ideally optimized,
but it hints at the kind of optimizations
that linear algebra computations do in practice.

Common code:

```c++
template<class Layout>
using out_matrix_view = mdspan<float, dextents<int, 2>, Layout>;

template<class Layout>
using in_matrix_view = mdspan<const float, dextents<int, 2>, Layout>;

// Before this proposal, if Layout is layout_left or layout_right,
// the returned mdspan would all be layout_stride.
// After this proposal, the returned mdspan would be
// layout_left_padded resp. layout_right_padded.
template<class ElementType, class Layout>
auto partition(mdspan<ElementType, dextents<int, 2>, Layout> A)
{
  auto M = A.extent(0);
  auto N = A.extent(1);
  auto A00 = submdspan(A, tuple{0, M / 2}, tuple{0, N / 2});
  auto A01 = submdspan(A, tuple{0, M / 2}, tuple{N / 2, N});
  auto A10 = submdspan(A, tuple{M / 2, M}, tuple{0, N / 2});
  auto A11 = submdspan(A, tuple{M / 2, M}, tuple{N / 2, N});
  return tuple{
    A00, A01,
    A10, A11
  };
}

template<class Layout>
void recursive_matrix_product(in_matrix_view<Layout> A,
  in_matrix_view<Layout> B, out_matrix_view<Layout> C)
{
  // Some hardware-dependent constant
  constexpr int recursion_threshold = 16;
  if(std::max(C.extent(0) || C.extent(1)) <= recursion_threshold) {
    base_case_matrix_product(A, B, C);
  } else {
    auto [C00, C01,
          C10, C11] = partition(C);  
    auto [A00, A01,
          A10, A11] = partition(A);  
    auto [B00, B01,
          B10, B11] = partition(B);
    recursive_matrix_product(A00, B00, C00);
    recursive_matrix_product(A01, B10, C00);
    recursive_matrix_product(A10, B00, C10);
    recursive_matrix_product(A11, B10, C10);
    recursive_matrix_product(A00, B01, C01);
    recursive_matrix_product(A01, B11, C01);
    recursive_matrix_product(A10, B01, C11);
    recursive_matrix_product(A11, B11, C11);
  }
}

// Slow generic implementation
template<class Layout>
void base_case_matrix_product(in_matrix_view<Layout> A,
  in_matrix_view<Layout> B, out_matrix_view<Layout> C)
{
  for(size_t j = 0; j < C.extent(1); ++j) {
    for(size_t i = 0; i < C.extent(0); ++i) {
      typename out_matrix_view<Layout>::value_type C_ij{};
      for(size_t k = 0; k < A.extent(1); ++k) {
        C_ij += A(i,k) * B(k,j);
      }
      C(i,j) += C_ij;
    }
  }
}
```

A user might interpret `layout_left` as "column major,"
and therefore "the natural layout to pass into the BLAS."

```c++
void base_case_matrix_product(in_matrix_view<layout_left> A,
  in_matrix_view<layout_left> B, out_matrix_view<layout_left> C)
{
  cblas_sgemm(CblasColMajor, CblasNoTrans, CblasNoTrans,
    C.extent(0), C.extent(1), A.extent(1), 1.0f,
    A.data_handle(), A.stride(1), B.data_handle(), B.stride(1),
    1.0f, C.data_handle(), C.stride(1));
}
```

However, `recursive_matrix_product` never gets to use
the `layout_left` overload of `base_case_matrix_product`,
because the base case matrices are always `layout_stride`.

On discovering this, the author of these functions
might be tempted to write a custom layout for "BLAS-compatible" matrices.
However, the `submdspan` proposal
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2630r0.html">P2630R0</a>
currently forces `partition` to return four `layout_stride` mdspan
if given a `layout_left` (or `layout_right`) input mdspan.
This would, in turn, force users of `recursive_matrix_product`
to commit to a custom layout, if they want to use the BLAS.

Alternately, the author of these functions could specialize
`base_case_matrix_product` for `layout_stride`, and check whether
`A.stride(0)`, `B.stride(0)`, and `C.stride(0)` are all equal to one
before calling `cblas_sgemm`.
However, that would force extra run-time checks for a use case
that most users might never encounter,
because most users are starting with `layout_left` matrices
or contiguous submatrices thereof.

After our proposal, the author can specialize `base_case_matrix_product`
for exactly the layout supported by the BLAS.
They could even get rid of the fall-back implementation
if users never exercise it.

```c++
template<size_t p>
void base_case_matrix_product(in_matrix_view<layout_left_padded<p>> A,
  in_matrix_view<layout_left_padded<p>> B,
  out_matrix_view<layout_left_padded<p>> C)

### Overaligned access

By combining these new layouts with an accessor
that ensures overaligned access,
we can create an mdspan for which the beginning
of every contiguous segment of elements
is overaligned by some given factor.
This can enable use of hardware features 
that require overaligned memory access.

The following `aligned_accessor` class template
(which this proposal does *not* propose to add to the C++ Standard Library)
uses the C++ Standard Library function `assume_aligned`
to decorate pointer access.

```c++
template<class ElementType, std::size_t byte_alignment>
struct aligned_accessor {
  // Even if a pointer p is aligned, p + i might not be.
  using offset_policy = std::default_accessor<ElementType>;

  using element_type = ElementType;
  using reference = ElementType&;
  // Some implementations might have an easier time optimizing
  // if this class applies an attribute to the pointer type.
  // Examples of attributes include
  // __declspec(align_value(byte_alignment))
  // and
  // __attribute__((align_value(byte_alignment))).
  using data_handle_type = ElementType*;

  constexpr aligned_accessor() noexcept = default;

  // A feature of default_accessor that permits
  // conversion from nonconst to const.
  template<class OtherElementType, std::size_t other_byte_alignment>
  requires (
    std::is_convertible_v<OtherElementType(*)[], element_type(*)[]> &&
    other_byte_alignment == byte_alignment)
  constexpr aligned_accessor(
    aligned_accessor<OtherElementType, other_byte_alignment>) noexcept
  {}

  constexpr reference
  access(data_handle_type p, size_t i) const noexcept {
    return std::assume_aligned< byte_alignment >(p)[i];
  }

  constexpr typename offset_policy::data_handle_type
  offset(data_handle_type p, size_t i) const noexcept {
    return p + i;
  }
};
```

We include some helper functions for making overaligned array allocations.

```c++
template<class ElementType>
struct delete_raw {
  void operator()(ElementType* p) const {
    std::free(p);
  }
};

template<class ElementType>
using allocation_t =
  std::unique_ptr<ElementType[], delete_raw<ElementType>>;

template<class ElementType, std::size_t byte_alignment>
allocation_t<ElementType>
allocate_raw(const std::size_t num_elements)
{
  const std::size_t num_bytes = num_elements * sizeof(ElementType);
  void* ptr = std::aligned_alloc(byte_alignment, num_bytes);
  return {ptr, delete_raw<ElementType>{}};
}
```

Now we can show our example.
This 15 x 17 matrix of `float` will have extra padding so that
every column is aligned to `8 * sizeof(float)` bytes.
We can use the layout mapping to determine
the required storage size (including padding).
Users can then prove at compile time
that they can use special hardware features
that require overaligned access
and/or assume that the padding element
at the end of each column is accessible memory.

```c++
constexpr std::size_t element_alignment = 8;
constexpr std::size_t byte_alignment = element_alignment * sizeof(float);

using layout_type = layout_left_padded<element_alignment>;
layout_type::mapping mapping{dextents<int, 2>{15, 17}};
auto allocation =
  allocate_raw<float, byte_alignment>(mapping.required_span_size());

using accessor_type = aligned_accessor<float, byte_alignment>;
mdspan m{allocation.get(), mapping, accessor_type{}};

// m_sub has the same layout as m,
// and each column of m_sub has the same overalignment.
auto m_sub = submdspan(m, tuple{0, 11}, tuple{1, 13}); 
```

## Alternatives

We considered a variant of `layout_stride` that could encode
any combination of compile-time or run-time strides in the layout type.
This could, for example, use the same mechanism that `extents` uses.
(The reference implementation calls this mechanism a "partially static array.")
However, we rejected this approach as overly complex for our design goals.

First, the goal of `layout_{left,right}_padded` isn't to insist even harder
that the compiler bake constants into `mapping::operator()` evaluation.
The goal is to communicate compile-time information to *users*.
The most benefit comes not just from knowing the padding stride at compile time,
but also from knowing that one dimension always uses stride-one (contiguous) storage.
Putting these two pieces of information together
lets users apply compiler annotations like `assume_aligned`,
as in the above `aligned_accessor` example.
Knowing that one dimension always uses contiguous storage
also tells users that they can pass the mdspan's data
directly into C or Fortran libraries like the BLAS or LAPACK.
Users can benefit from this even if the padding stride is a run-time value.

Second, the `constexpr` annotations in the existing layout mappings
mean that users might be evaluating `layout_stride::mapping::operator()`
fully at compile time.  The reference mdspan implementation has
<a href="https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan/tree/stable/compilation_tests">several tests</a>
that demonstrate this by using the result of a layout mapping evaluation
in a context where it needs to be known at compile time.

Third, the performance benefit of storing <it>some</it> strides
as compile-time constants goes down as the rank increases,
because most of the strides would end up depending on run-time values anyway.
Strided mdspan generally come from a subview
of an existing `layout_left` or `layout_right` mdspan.
In that case, the representation of the strides
that preserves the most compile-time information
would be just the original mdspan's `extents_type` object.
(Compare to the exposition-only <it>`inner-mapping_`</it>
which we use in the wording for `layout_{left,right}_padded`.)
Computing each stride would then call for a forward (for `layout_left`)
or reverse (for `layout_right`) product of the original mdspan's extents.
As a result, any stride to the right resp. left of a run-time extent
would end up depending on that run-time extent anyway.
The larger the rank, the more strides get "touched" by run-time information.

Fourth, a strided mdspan that can represent layouts as general as `layout_stride`,
but has entirely compile-time extents *and* strides,
could be useful for supporting features of a specific computer architecture.
However, these hardware features would probably have limitations
that would prevent them from supporting general strided layouts anyway.
For example, they might require strides to be a power of two,
or they might be limited to specific ranges of extents or strides.
These limitations would call for custom implementation-specific layouts,
not something as general as a "compile-time `layout_stride`."

## Implementation experience

Pull request <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan/pull/180">180</a>
in the <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan/">reference mdspan implementation</a>
implements most of this proposal.
Next steps are to add constructors to the existing layout mappings,
and to add `submdspan` support for the new layouts.

Throughout this section, let `P_right` be the following
size `extents_type::rank()` parameter pack of `size_t`:

* If `extents_type::rank()` equals zero or one, then the empty parameter pack;

* else, the parameter pack `size_t(0)`, `size_t(1)`, ..., `extents_type::rank() - 2`.

*Mandates:* If

* `extents_type::rank()` is greater than one,

* `padding_stride` does not equal `dynamic_extent`, and

* `extents_type::static_extent(extents_type::rank() - 1)` does not equal `dynamic_extent`,

then the least multiple of `padding_stride`
that is greater than or equal to
`extents_type::static_extent(extents_type::rank() - 1)`
is representable as a value of type `size_t`,
and is representable as a value of type `index_type`.

```c++
static constexpr size_t <it>actual-padding-stride</it> = /* see-below */; // exposition only
```

* If `extents_type::rank()` equals zero or one, then `padding_stride`.

* Else, if

    * `padding_stride` does not equal `dynamic_extent` and

    * `extents_type::static_extent(0)` does not equal `dynamic_extent`,

    then the `size_t` value which is the least multiple of `padding_stride`
    that is greater than or equal to `extents_type::static_extent(0)`.

* Otherwise, `dynamic_extent`.

```c++
using <it>inner-extents-type</it> = /* see-below */; // exposition only
```

* If `extents_type::rank()` equals zero or one,
    then <it>`inner-extents-type`</it> names the type `extents_type`.

* Otherwise, <it>`inner-extents-type`</it> names the type
    `extents<index_type, extents_type::static_extent(P_right)...,` <it>`actual-padding-stride`</it> `>`.

```c++
using <it>unpadded-extent-type</it> = /* see-below */; // exposition only
```

* If `extents_type::rank()` equals zero,
    then <it>`unpadded-extent-type`</it> names the type `extents<index_type>`.

* Otherwise, <it>`unpadded-extent-type`</it> names the type
    `extents<index_type, extents_type::static_extent(Extents::rank() - 1)>`.

```c++
constexpr mapping(const extents_type& ext);
```

*Preconditions:* If `extents_type::rank()` is greater than one
and `padding_stride` does not equal `dynamic_extent`,
then the least multiple of `padding_stride`
greater than to equal to `ext.extent(extents_type::rank() - 1)`
is representable as a value of type `index_type`.

*Effects:*

* Direct-non-list-initializes <it>`inner-mapping_`</it> with:

    * `ext`, if `extents_type::rank()` is zero or one; else,

    * `ext.extent(P_right)..., ext.extent(extents_type::rank() - 1)`,
        if `padding_stride` is `dynamic_extent`; else,

    * `ext.extent(P_right)..., S_right`, where `S_right` is the least multiple of `padding_stride` greater than or equal to `ext.extent(extents_type::rank() - 1)`; and

* if `extents_type::rank()` is zero, value-initializes <it>`unpadded-extent_`</it>;
    else, direct-non-list-initializes <it>`unpadded-extent_`</it> with
    `ext.extent(extents_type::rank() - 1)`.

```c++
template<class Size>
constexpr mapping(const extents_type& ext, Size padding_value);
```

*Constraints:*

* `is_convertible_v<Size, index_type>` is `true`, and

* `is_nothrow_constructible_v<index_type, Size>` is `true`.

*Preconditions:*

* If `padding_stride` does not equal `dynamic_extent`, then

    * `padding_value` is representable as a value of type `index_type`, and

    * the result of converting `padding_value` to `index_type`
    equals `padding_stride`.

* If `extents_type::rank()` is greater than one,
    then the least multiple of `padding_value`
    greater than to equal to `ext.extent(extents_type::rank() - 1)`
    is representable as a value of type `index_type`.

*Effects:*

* Direct-non-list-initializes <it>`inner-mapping_`</it> with:

    * `ext`, if `extents_type::rank()` is zero or one; else
    
    * `ext.extent(P_right)..., S_right`, where `S_right` is the least multiple of `padding_value` greater than or equal to `ext.extent(extents_type::rank() - 1)`; and

* if `extents_type::rank()` is zero, value-initializes <it>`unpadded-extent_`</it>;
    else, direct-non-list-initializes <it>`unpadded-extent_`</it> with

```c++
template<size_t other_padding_stride, class OtherExtents>
  constexpr explicit( /* see below */ )
    mapping(const layout_right_padded<other_padding_stride>::mapping<OtherExtents>& other);
```

*Constraints:* `is_constructible_v<extents_type, OtherExtents>` is `true`.

*Mandates:* `padding_stride == dynamic_extent || other_padding_stride == dynamic_extent || padding_stride == other_padding_stride` is `true`.

*Preconditions:*

* If `extents_type::rank() > 1` is `true`
    and `padding_stride` does not equal `dynamic_extent`,
    then `other.stride(extents_type::rank() - 2)` equals
    the least multiple of `padding_stride` greater than or equal to
    `extents_type::` <it>`index-cast`</it> `(other.extent(OtherExtents::rank() - 1))`; and

* `other.required_span_size()` is representable
    as a value of type `index_type` (*[basic.fundamental]*).

*Effects:* 

* Direct-non-list-initializes <it>`inner-mapping_`</it> with:

    * `other.extents()`, if `extents_type::rank()` is zero or one; else,
    
    * `other.extents().extent(P_right)..., other.stride(extents_type::rank() - 2)`; and

* if `extents_type::rank()` is zero, value-initializes <it>`unpadded-extent_`</it>;
    else, direct-non-list-initializes <it>`unpadded-extent_`</it> with
    `other.extents().extent(extents_type::rank() - 1)`.

*Remarks:* The expression inside `explicit` is equivalent to:
`extents_type::rank() > 1 && (padding_stride == dynamic_extent || other_padding_stride == dynamic_extent)`.

```c++
template<size_t other_padding_stride, class OtherExtents>
  constexpr explicit(not is_convertible_v<OtherExtents, extents_type>)
    mapping(const layout_left_padded<other_padding_stride>::mapping<OtherExtents>& other) noexcept;
```

*Constraints:*

* `extents_type::rank()` equals zero or one, and

* `is_constructible_v<extents_type, OtherExtents>` is `true`.

*Preconditions:* `other.required_span_size()` is representable
as a value of type `index_type` (*[basic.fundamental]*).

*Effects:* 

* Direct-non-list-initializes <it>`inner-mapping_`</it> with `other.extents()`; and

* if `extents_type::rank()` is zero, value-initializes <it>`unpadded-extent_`</it>;
    else, initializes <it>`unpadded-extent_`</it> with
    `other.extents().extent(0)`.

<i>[Note:</i> Neither mapping uses the padding stride
in the rank-0 or rank-1 case, so the padding stride does not affect
either the constraints or the preconditions. <i>— end note]</i>

```c++
constexpr extents_type extents() const noexcept;
```

*Effects:* 

* If `extents_type::rank()` is zero, equivalent to `return extents_type{};`.

* Otherwise, equivalent to
    `return extents_type(`<it>`inner-mapping_`</it>`.extent(P_right)..., `<it>`unpadded-extent_`</it>`.extent(extents_type::rank() - 1));`.

```c++

  strides() const noexcept;

*Effects:* Equivalent to `return `<it>`inner-mapping_`</it>`.strides();`.

```

*Effects:* Equivalent to `return `<it>`inner-mapping_`</it>`.required_span_size();`.

```c++
template<class... Indices>
constexpr size_t operator()(Indices... idxs) const noexcept;
```

*Constraints:*

* `sizeof...(Indices) == Extents::rank()` is `true`,

* `(std::is_convertible_v<Indices, index_type> && ...)` is `true`, and

* `(std::is_nothrow_constructible<index_type, Indices> && ...)` is `true`.

*Precondition:* `extents_type::`_`index-cast`_`(i)`
is a multidimensional index in `extents()` ([mdspan.overview]).

*Effects:* Let `P` be a parameter pack such that
`is_same_v<index_sequence_for<Indices...>, index_sequence<P...>>` is `true`.
Equivalent to: `return ((static_cast<index_type>(i) * stride(P)) + ... + 0);`.

<i>[Note:</i>
Effects are also equivalent to
<it>`return inner-mapping_`</it>`(idxs...);`,
but only after the Precondition has been applied.

static constexpr bool is_always_exhaustive() noexcept;
